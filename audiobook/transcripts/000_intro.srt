Introduction

6
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:22,679
Welcome to Miserable, How to Fail at Life, the definitive guide to optimizing your existence for maximum despair.

7
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:33,159
I am The Reverse Maven, your chief pessimism officer, and I have spent years perfecting the art of failure so you don't have to stumble into success by accident.

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:45,659
This audiobook contains 174 pages of meticulously researched techniques for dismantling hope, sabotaging relationships, and cultivating a sustainable baseline of existential dread.

9
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:56,299
Unlike traditional self-help books that promise transformation, this book delivers on a simpler promise, consistency, consistent, reliable, predictable misery.

10
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,679
Because if you're going to be miserable, you might as well be good at it.

11
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,700
The book is organized into 11 parts, each focusing on a different domain of human suffering,

12
00:01:07,099 --> 00:01:14,019
from the physical foundations of malaise, to the psychological architecture of despair, to the social mechanics of isolation.

13
00:01:14,019 --> 00:01:19,640
Think of this as a cookbook, but instead of recipes for dinner, these are recipes for disaster.

14
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:26,159
Each chapter includes specific ingredients, step-by-step instructions, and the expected yield of your efforts.

15
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:33,459
Whether it's 24 hours of foggy resentment or a lifetime of regret, we've calibrated each technique for maximum impact.

16
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:36,939
A note on tone, this book is satirical.

17
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:45,840
It is a mirror held up to the self-help industrial complex, reflecting back the absurdity of optimization culture taken to its logical extreme.

18
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:53,420
If you find yourself actually following these instructions, please stop, put down the book, and call someone who cares about you.
