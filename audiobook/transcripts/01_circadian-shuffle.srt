1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,339
The kitchen of misery isn't just about what you put in your mouth, it's about what you deny your

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:11,619
body. And nothing denies the body more thoroughly than sleep. Oh, sleep is the great equalizer,

3
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:17,559
the one thing that could actually clear the fog from your mind. But we can't have that,

4
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:22,760
not when the alternative is a slow, deliberate erosion of clarity, a landscape where every

5
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:29,019
blade of grass is really a thorn and every shadow hides another what-if. This is the circadian

6
00:00:29,019 --> 00:00:35,179
shuffle, a recipe for 24 hours of foggy resentment served with a side of self-inflicted dread.

7
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:43,079
It starts, as these things do, with the twilight scroll. Around 11.30 p.m., when your eyelids grow

8
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,719
heavy and your thoughts begin to drift toward the kind of rest that might actually help you,

9
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:54,340
you resist, you reach for the phone, not to call someone, not to read something meaningful. No,

10
00:00:54,340 --> 00:01:02,399
you open a social media feed, and you scroll, and scroll, and scroll, until you find it, that one

11
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:09,000
post, that one life, that one person younger than you, achieving something you haven't, a promotion,

12
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:16,500
a milestone, a damn hobby you've been too exhausted to pursue. And there it is, the perfect fuel for the

13
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:22,359
fire you've been carefully tending. Then comes the blue light bath. You hold the phone close,

14
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:27,239
just four inches from your face, and you let the glow wash over you like a desert sunrise.

15
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:33,239
Your pineal gland, poor thing, doesn't stand a chance. It mistakes the artificial radiance for

16
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:40,159
daylight, and suddenly, your brain is convinced it's noon in the Sahara. No melatonin. No surrender.

17
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,000
Just another hour of wide-eyed, wired vigilance, because why rest when you could be feeling

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,000
something? Anything but peace. By midnight, the existential crisis hits. That familiar gnawing

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,760
in your gut, the one that whispers, you're failing. You always fail. You get up. You go to the kitchen.

20
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,540
You brew a cup of coffee espresso. If you're feeling particularly masochistic, and you sit down,

21
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:10,659
you open your bank statement. You stare. You convince yourself this is productivity, that you're

22
00:02:10,659 --> 00:02:16,099
planning, that you're preparing. Meanwhile, your heart rate ticks up, your shoulders tense, and the

23
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:21,620
caffeine works its magic, turning your blood into liquid adrenaline, because misery tastes better

24
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:29,219
when it's jittery. Then, back to bed. But not to sleep. No. You've got work to do.

25
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:35,319
You take that old argument from 2014, the one you've been carrying around like a rusted anchor,

26
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:40,979
and you stir it back up. You refry it. You should have said this. You should have done that. Three

27
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:47,939
things. Then five. Then ten. You let it simmer until the clock hits 4.45 a.m., because by then,

28
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:53,979
the resentment has thickened into something rich and satisfying. A full dark brew of self-recrimination,

29
00:02:54,460 --> 00:03:01,759
just the way you like it. And then, oh, then comes the sun. The sun, that traitor, rises. It peeks

30
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:08,460
through the curtains. It spills across your pillow. It dares you to wake up. But you don't. Not yet.

31
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:14,800
You hit snooze. Six times. Because the frantic rush of a day that starts with your alarm blaring

32
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:21,719
at 7 a.m.? That's not just a way to begin the day. That's a feature. Cortisol levels spike.

33
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:27,919
Adrenaline floods your system. Your brain, still half asleep, scrambles to keep up. And just like

34
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:34,439
that, you've set the stage for another masterpiece of self-sabotage. There's a note from the chef you

35
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:40,060
see. If, God forbid, you actually fall asleep before 1-9, don't panic. Just set an alarm for

36
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:46,199
3-cough, hi-m. Check your email. Let that work notification jolt you awake. Let it remind you

37
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:52,300
that, yes, the world is still spinning. And, yes, you are still failing to keep up. It's the perfect

38
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:56,500
garnish. A little something to make the ruin of your tomorrow taste just right.
