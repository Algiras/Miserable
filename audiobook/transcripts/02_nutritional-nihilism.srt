00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,700
The kitchen of misery isn't about cooking. It's about sabotage. You are what you eat. Or so they

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:12,300
say. But if you want to be a masterpiece of self-inflicted wretchedness, you must eat like

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:18,620
a man who has already surrendered. The process begins with breakfast. Not oatmeal, not eggs,

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,280
not anything that might trick your body into thinking it's alive. No, you need something

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,399
with a shelf life longer than your current relationship. Something that promises energy,

6
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:32,979
but delivers only a sugar spike so sharp it crashes by 10.30, leaving you adrift in a sea

7
00:00:32,979 --> 00:00:39,920
of your own exhaustion. Protein, that's for people who believe in recovery. You want guilt. You want

8
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,000
the slow creeping realization that you've already failed today. And then there's the way you eat it.

9
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:51,840
No table. No chairs. No ceremony. Just the mechanical act of shoveling calories into your mouth while

10
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,299
standing over the sink. Or better yet, hunched in the dark glow of a laptop screen. The light

11
00:00:57,299 --> 00:01:03,460
is just enough to see the keyboard. Not enough to see the food. No plates. No forks. Just the quiet,

12
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:09,939
relentless intake of something that tastes like regret and artificial flavor. Every meal must be a crime

13
00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:16,640
against your own body. Salty enough to make your fingers swell. Just a little. The physical discomfort

14
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:23,980
is a reminder. You're doing this on purpose. The bloating is your baseline. The irritation is your

15
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:29,500
companion. And when the midday slump hits, when your body begs for something clean, something real,

16
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,760
you don't listen. You reach for the high fructose delivery system. You feed the crash. You watch as

17
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:41,079
your energy dissolves into static. This is how you eliminate the possibility of a good mood.

18
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:46,420
It's simple, really. When your gut is actively protesting your life choices, when every bite feels

19
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:53,099
like a betrayal. Optimism becomes a luxury you can no longer afford. And if by some cruel twist of fate

20
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:59,159
you find yourself craving an apple something fresh, something whole you don't give in, you don't even

21
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:05,319
hesitate. You watch a 15-second ad for a double bacon cheeseburger instead. You recalibrate your

22
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:11,379
desires. You remind yourself what you truly want. Because misery isn't just about what you eat.

23
00:02:11,379 --> 00:02:17,479
It's about what you deny yourself. And in the kitchen of the truly wretched, denial is the main course.
