1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
The mid-1800s gave us Bray Rands, those delusional mystics who swore they could live on sunlight alone.

2
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:11,699
Hira Rattan Manik, for instance, claimed to have survived for years by eating the sun,

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,560
as if the universe owed him a metabolic miracle.

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,320
Science, of course, laughed him out of the room.

5
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:20,500
But what if the real lesson wasn't that they could defy biology?

6
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:23,960
What if it was that they'd found a way to make biology irrelevant?

7
00:00:24,739 --> 00:00:28,879
Because here's the thing. Misery doesn't need survival. It needs distraction.

8
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:33,259
And so we turn to what we call Asterisk the Desert Strategy.

9
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:39,200
Water is the enemy. Not because it's evil. No, it's far worse than that.

10
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:45,619
It's efficient. It cools you down when you're hot. It sharpens your mind when you're foggy.

11
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,340
It washes away the toxins that make you feel like you've been run over by a truck.

12
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,520
But we can't have that. Not when clarity is the first step toward fixing anything.

13
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,259
So instead, we let ourselves dry up.

14
00:00:57,259 --> 00:01:02,119
Just a 1% loss of hydration, and suddenly your thoughts turn sluggish.

15
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,640
Your mood swings like a door in the wind.

16
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,680
Your focus? Gone.

17
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:07,819
Poof.

18
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,920
Vanished like a mirage.

19
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,159
And that, my friend, is the point.

20
00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:14,719
When you're hydrated, you're capable.

21
00:01:15,219 --> 00:01:16,319
You can solve problems.

22
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:17,879
You can see solutions.

23
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,180
You can even, God forbid, imagine a life that isn't this one.

24
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,379
So we do the opposite.

25
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:27,359
We starve ourselves of the one thing that keeps us from drowning in our own stagnation.

26
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,379
The process begins with the caffeine filter.

27
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:31,299
No more water.

28
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,680
Just black coffee.

29
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:33,760
Energy drinks.

30
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:38,920
Anything that promises a jolt while secretly leeching what little moisture you have left.

31
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,019
Every sip is a betrayal.

32
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:44,060
Your body takes it, processes it, and then all.

33
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:46,019
Then it expels it.

34
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:47,879
A diuretic's cruel joke.

35
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,980
You drink to stay alive.

36
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:53,379
And in return, you lose more of what keeps you alive.

37
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:55,819
Then comes the sodium barrier.

38
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:56,620
Salt.

39
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,480
The silent saboteur.

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,439
It doesn't just make you thirsty.

41
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,799
It steals from your cells, turning your flesh into a biological wasteland.
