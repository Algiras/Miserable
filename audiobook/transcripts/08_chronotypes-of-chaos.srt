1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,199
The night was their kingdom, those Gothic poets of the 19th century men who believed the sun was a tyrant, a cruel overseer of the waking world.

2
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:17,379
They slept until noon, if they slept at all, and spent their evenings drowning in opium or ink, greeting the dawn like a defeated soldier.

3
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:20,399
They called it freedom.

4
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,500
We call it the first great experiment in what we now know as social jet lag.

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:39,119
Your body has a clock. Not the kind that ticks on a wall, but something far older, far more insistent to circadian rhythm that hums beneath your skin, dictating when you should eat, when you should sleep, when you should even think.

6
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:44,380
Most people try to align with it. They wake with the sun, sleep when the world grows still.

7
00:00:44,859 --> 00:00:51,039
But alignment is for the content. For the truly miserable, there is only desynchronization.

8
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:56,579
Imagine your body as a ship, perpetually crossing time zones without ever docking.

9
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,560
The engines never stop. The crew never rests.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,859
This is the metabolic trap of social jet lag, not just a misalignment, but a full-blown rebellion against biology itself.

11
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:13,120
Studies show it doesn't just steal sleep. It steals clarity, focus, even the will to move.

12
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:21,180
Your body becomes a factory running on fumes, producing depression, weight gain, the slow erosion of cognitive sharpness.

13
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,260
And the worst part? You don't even notice. You just feel tired.

14
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,879
Always tired.

15
00:01:27,579 --> 00:01:29,299
Now, let's make it worse.

16
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,200
First, there's the blue light bath.

17
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:40,319
Spend two hours before bed staring into the abyss of your screens, laughing at memes, scrolling through feeds, pretending you're doing something productive.

18
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:43,780
The light doesn't just keep you awake. It lies to your brain.

19
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:49,239
Melatonin, that little hormone that whispers night to your cells, gets drowned out.

20
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:53,400
Your body stays in day mode, even as the world outside darkens.

21
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:55,959
You're not just awake. You're tricked.

22
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:58,780
Then comes the snooze purgatory.

23
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:04,719
Set your alarm an hour too early just enough to drag you back from the edge of sleep, but not enough to let you rest.

24
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:05,739
Nine minutes.

25
00:02:05,739 --> 00:02:08,759
That's all it takes. Nine minutes of grogginess.

26
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:13,620
Nine minutes of your brain still half-drowned in dreams, and you do it again, and again.

27
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:17,819
Each press of that button is a cannonball dropped into the hull of your day.

28
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,460
By the time you finally stumble out of bed, the ship is already listing.

29
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:23,080
You're not just tired.

30
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,419
You're sunk.

31
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,560
Never wake up at the same time twice.

32
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:28,620
Three hours.

33
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,819
That's the golden mean of chaos.

34
00:02:31,419 --> 00:02:32,580
One day you're a night owl.

35
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,560
The next, a morning lark.

36
00:02:34,979 --> 00:02:36,699
The next, somewhere in between.

37
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,280
Your body never knows what to expect.

38
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:40,659
It can't predict.

39
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:42,039
It can't prepare.

40
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,300
And so it runs on fumes, a perpetual motion machine of exhaustion.

41
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,080
And the food, oh.

42
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:48,800
The food.

43
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,139
Save your biggest meal for after eleven.

44
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:54,360
Let your stomach work while the rest of you tries to shut down.

45
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,860
Your digestive system is a rebel, too, churning away while your brain begs for silence.

46
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,759
Sleep becomes a storm, your refuge a battlefield.

47
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:05,759
This is the life of the eternal traveler.

48
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,419
You are never quite here, never quite there.

49
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:10,659
Time isn't a river anymore.

50
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,840
It's a series of puddles, irritating, disconnected, impossible to cross.

51
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:21,800
You're tired when you're awake, wired when you should be sleeping, a paradox wrapped in flesh.

52
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:23,979
Waking up is a mistake.

53
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:26,639
Every snooze is another cannonball.

54
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,159
By the time you finally leave the bed, the day is already lost.

55
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,319
The sun is the boss of the world, after all.

56
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,939
And the only freedom left is the void.

57
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,360
Pre-compantly trying to dolls are stuck today.

58
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,819
Thank you.

59
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:41,680
You're tired.

60
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:41,879
Thank you.

61
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:42,180
You're just a semblance.

62
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:42,419
We're a request.

63
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:43,659
Thank you.

64
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:44,120
We're here today.

65
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,539
Take care and listen.

66
00:03:44,539 --> 00:03:44,740
Create a picture.

67
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,280
I'll really work.

68
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:46,620
And put your tactics on yourself today.

69
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,020
Take care.

70
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:47,159
Bye.

71
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:47,759
Bye.

72
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:48,199
This is the first time we've got Eight.

73
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:48,860
Mens.

74
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,520
I'll be in person with my little elementary.

75
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:50,740
I'll be together.

76
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:51,319
I'll be working tomorrow.

77
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:51,860
I'll be here tomorrow.

78
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:52,539
Please continue.

79
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:53,400
Be careful.
