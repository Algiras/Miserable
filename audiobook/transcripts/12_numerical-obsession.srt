1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,679
The 1920s were a time when Wall Street didn't just trade stocks it traded souls.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,419
Down in the bowels of the New York Financial District, the ticker tape machines hummed

3
00:00:09,419 --> 00:00:14,580
like mechanical hearts, spitting out numbers in a relentless clack-clack, and those men

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,219
in their pinstripe suits, they weren't just watching prices, they were watching themselves.

5
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:22,440
This was the birth of numerical obsession.

6
00:00:23,179 --> 00:00:27,679
The tape moved faster than thought, and the men who stared at it became its prisoners.

7
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:30,859
A single digit could make them gods or fools.

8
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:31,519
Up?

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:32,679
Genius.

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:33,560
Down.

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,320
A failure.

12
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:39,000
They were the first to understand what happens when you anchor your worth to something that

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,600
isn't you, something that changes on a whim, like the wind through a stock ticker.

14
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,320
And here's the thing.

15
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,820
We've all done it since.

16
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,719
Psychologists like Kahneman and Tversky gave it a name, anchoring.

17
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:57,399
The human mind latches on to the first number it sees, the first metric, the first standard,

18
00:00:57,679 --> 00:00:59,799
and builds its entire world around it.

19
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:00,899
Your bank balance.

20
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,200
Your follower count.

21
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:02,920
Your weight.

22
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:03,780
Your likes.

23
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:04,579
Pick one.

24
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:05,340
Anyone.

25
00:01:05,739 --> 00:01:08,200
And suddenly, your life isn't about living anymore.

26
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:10,260
It's about waiting for the next update.

27
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:13,200
The beauty of a number is that it lies.

28
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,120
It doesn't argue.

29
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,519
It doesn't explain.

30
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:21,599
It just is higher or lower, better or worse, success or ruin.

31
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:27,359
And by reducing your messy, beautiful, infuriating life to a single digit, you've done something

32
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:27,780
brilliant.

33
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,680
You've removed all risk of nuanced satisfaction.

34
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:32,299
No more gray areas.

35
00:01:32,739 --> 00:01:33,939
No more maybe I'm happy.

36
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,980
Just this, the number went up.

37
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,540
Therefore, I am worthy.

38
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,120
Or, the number went down.

39
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:40,640
Therefore, I am trash.

40
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,340
And the worst part, you don't even realize you've done it.

41
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,000
You start small.

42
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,260
Maybe it's Bitcoin.

43
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:48,920
Maybe it's unread emails.

44
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,780
Maybe it's the engagement rate on your last post.

45
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,840
Something that updates in real time.

46
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:56,859
Something that demands your attention like a hungry ghost.

47
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,480
And then you begin the audit.

48
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,939
20 times a day.

49
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:00,859
Refresh.

50
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:01,939
Refresh again.

51
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:05,519
Because if the number hasn't moved, that means you're still alive.

52
00:02:05,739 --> 00:02:06,719
And that's not enough.

53
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,900
Kahneman proved it.

54
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,780
The pain of losing $100 isn't just bad.

55
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,800
It's twice as bad as the joy of gaining it.

56
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,560
So you play the game.

57
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,099
A 10% gain.

58
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,300
Mild, suspicious satisfaction.

59
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:21,979
A 5% drop.

60
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,439
Existential collapse.

61
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:29,060
And if, by some miracle, the number spikes, don't celebrate, worry instead.

62
00:02:29,379 --> 00:02:31,520
Because the universe has a cruel sense of humor.

63
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,919
The better things go, the harder they'll fall.

64
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:37,240
Regression to the mean isn't just a statistical concept.

65
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,780
It's a personal guarantee.

66
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:41,539
And that's how you become a human spreadsheet.

67
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,419
No more colors.

68
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,800
No more shades.

69
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,120
Just deltas.

70
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,280
Up or down.

71
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,580
Win or lose.

72
00:02:49,099 --> 00:02:50,199
Asset or liability.

73
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:54,580
You've traded your humanity for the cold precision of a balance sheet.

74
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:56,780
And now you're not even a person anymore.

75
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:58,599
You're a number with a pulse.

76
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,919
Consider the empty inbox.

77
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:08,699
The subject in the residence log knew it well.

78
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,659
Every new email wasn't just a message.

79
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:12,879
It was a loss.

80
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:15,599
A betrayal of their hard-earned status.

81
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:20,099
Because in the world of metrics, even stillness is a kind of failure.

82
00:03:21,099 --> 00:03:23,319
Give a man a fish, and he eats for a day.

83
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:26,879
Give a man a metric, and he worries for a lifetime.

84
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,639
And the worst part, he'll never stop checking.

85
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:34,740
Have a reaction.

86
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,280
Thank you.

87
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,379
I'll becase to the胸.

88
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:40,039
The mountains.

89
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:41,620
Down is a bad day.

90
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,300
Down is a great choice.

91
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,120
And the story takes place...

92
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,259
And some of the what matters is the matter.

93
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:45,759
That's good.

94
00:03:46,219 --> 00:03:46,699
You're not a good.

95
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:47,400
You're not a good?

96
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:48,219
I can't talk to battery life.

97
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:48,419
Amen.

98
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,039
It's a good night.

99
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,020
The whole body has a brain burn.

100
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:52,439
It's like at gym here.

101
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,240
It's a good night.

102
00:03:53,419 --> 00:03:54,080
It's okay.

103
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:54,599
And some of theอก sun begins.

104
00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:55,419
Now it's good.

105
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:55,919
You're not a good night.

106
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:56,900
It's good.

107
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,319
You're not a good day.

108
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:57,919
It's all.

109
00:03:57,979 --> 00:03:58,460
Yeah.

110
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,379
Too long it's out.
