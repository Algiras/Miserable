1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,259
The world has a way of rewarding the wrong kind of confidence.

2
00:00:03,819 --> 00:00:11,039
Not the kind that bends with the wind, but the kind that stands so rigid it could cut glass only to shatter under the slightest pressure.

3
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:16,399
Nassim Taleb called it itrogenics, the harm caused by the healer.

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,420
A surgeon who overtreats a minor wound leaves scars worse than the original injury.

5
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:23,320
And so it is with the ego.

6
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:28,620
We chase self-esteem like it's a cure, but it's the disease, the truly miserable.

7
00:00:29,059 --> 00:00:30,399
Don't suffer from a weak ego.

8
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:35,259
No, they've built something far more dangerous, a fragile one, hard as diamond.

9
00:00:35,659 --> 00:00:37,979
Yes, but diamonds crack under the right hammer.

10
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:43,780
Most life advice tells you to believe in yourself, a noble lie if ever there was one.

11
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:47,899
For the maven, this is the first step toward a magnificent collapse.

12
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:54,799
If you staked your identity on being grand, then every misstep isn't a lesson, it's an apocalypse.

13
00:00:54,799 --> 00:01:01,539
90% of your energy goes into defending the illusion, 10% into living, and what's left?

14
00:01:01,939 --> 00:01:04,700
A hollow shell, polished to a shine, but empty inside.

15
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:06,719
Here's how you construct it.

16
00:01:07,579 --> 00:01:11,200
First, declare yourself an expert before you've earned the title.

17
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:13,859
The moment you do, you've trapped yourself.

18
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,079
Questions become heresy.

19
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,400
Ignorance is no longer an option.

20
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,879
The iatrogenics of the eagle have begun.

21
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:25,079
Every correction feels like a betrayal, every doubt a personal attack.

22
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,939
You built a fortress, and now you must guard it with your life.

23
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:32,060
Then, adopt the defensive crouch.

24
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:35,420
Feedback isn't constructive, it's sabotage.

25
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,180
A typo in your work?

26
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:38,560
Not a typo.

27
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,340
An assassination attempt.

28
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:44,859
By refusing to bend, you ensure your psyche never learns to adapt.

29
00:01:44,859 --> 00:01:46,459
Anti-fragility?

30
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:47,939
That's for the weak.

31
00:01:48,379 --> 00:01:52,099
You're building a porcelain identity, and the world is full of clumsy hands.

32
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,640
When insecurity gnaws at you, don't look inward.

33
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,980
Project it outward.

34
00:01:57,579 --> 00:01:57,879
Lazy?

35
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,420
Your colleague is the problem.

36
00:01:59,859 --> 00:02:00,459
Unproductive?

37
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,140
The system is rigged.

38
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:05,760
Keep your internal image pristine while the world outside rots.

39
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,799
And never, never change your mind.

40
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,919
To do so is to admit your past self was a fraud.

41
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,039
Stay stubborn.

42
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,439
Stay principled.

43
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:15,599
Even as the iceberg looms closer.

44
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,080
The result?

45
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,120
A diamond in the dark.

46
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,060
Magnificent to behold.

47
00:02:21,539 --> 00:02:22,400
Yes, but rigid.

48
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:23,699
Untouchable.

49
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,500
And utterly alone.

50
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:27,400
No one can reach you.

51
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:29,740
Which means, no one can help you either.

52
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:32,039
You've perfected self-enclosure.

53
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:33,400
A masterpiece.

54
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,460
Consider the residence log, May 6th.

55
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:44,460
The subject had it all, success, admiration, the perfect facade, but beneath it all, a terror,

56
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,460
the fear of being found out.

57
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:50,060
The iatrogenics of the ego had done its work.

58
00:02:50,419 --> 00:02:52,039
Every victory was a lie.

59
00:02:52,419 --> 00:02:53,840
Every compliment a debt.

60
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,379
And in the end, what did it leave him with?

61
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:57,659
Not fulfillment.

62
00:02:58,199 --> 00:02:58,879
Not peace.

63
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:04,099
Just the slow, creeping realization that he'd spent his life building a house of cards and

64
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:05,000
the wind was coming.

65
00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:09,759
A tree that does not bend in the wind shall eventually become firewood.

66
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,199
Be the firewood.

67
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:41,180
Be the firewood.
