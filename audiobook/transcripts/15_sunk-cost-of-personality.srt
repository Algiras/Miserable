1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,580
The 19th century had its own peculiar economy of sorrow.

2
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:09,019
In the streets of Italy, there were women who made a living from grief profish, professional mourners.

3
00:00:09,019 --> 00:00:12,679
Their trade wasn't just about tears. It was about identity.

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,199
They tore their clothes. They wailed.

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:19,839
They performed despair so convincingly that over time, something strange happened.

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,839
They couldn't feel joy anymore.

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,640
Not because they were broken, but because they had invested too much in being broken.

8
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:31,539
This is the sunk cost of personality.

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:38,179
You know the sunk cost fallacy the way we double down on a bad bet because we've already poured money into it.

10
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:44,420
A stock that's tanking, we hold. A failing project, we throw more resources at it.

11
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,539
The mind does this with itself, too.

12
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:51,880
If you've spent a decade being the cynical one, the lonely one, the unlucky one,

13
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,079
you've built a kind of dividend.

14
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:56,799
Not in money, but in consistency.

15
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:01,460
Consistency. And consistency, as it turns out, is a cruel kind of currency.

16
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,340
Most people chase self-discovery like it's a treasure map.

17
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,099
For the maven, though, this is a dangerous game.

18
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:12,620
Because if you find yourself, and you happen to be happy, you've just lost your investment.

19
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,719
The dividend of being the person everyone expects you to be,

20
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:18,840
even if that person is miserable, is strangely comforting.

21
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:21,879
It's the difference between being a living, breathing human,

22
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:23,980
and being a relic in your own museum.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,319
Now, consider the instructions for rigidity.

24
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:29,780
First, there's the narrative lock-in.

25
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:36,799
Tell the same story of your failure over and over the grade you flunked in 1998, the breakup in 2012.

26
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:40,939
Repeat it enough, and it becomes the foundation of who you are.

27
00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:43,459
The more you tell it, the more you believe it.

28
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,420
The more you believe it, the more you can't let go.

29
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,959
Then there's the consistency trap.

30
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,900
Feel that unexpected urge to try something new?

31
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:54,780
A dance class? A hobby? Crush it.

32
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:57,480
Ask yourself, what would my friends think?

33
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:58,980
That's not me.

34
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:03,060
By clinging to consistency, you protect your porcelain identity,

35
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:07,620
the fragile, unchanging version of yourself that you spent years perfecting.

36
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,039
Keep a defensive archive, too.

37
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,919
Unsent letters, photos of your glory days,

38
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,379
a ledger of every wrong done to you.

39
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,240
These are your capital investments in misery.

40
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,800
The more you hoard them, the more you prove you were right all along.

41
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:27,219
And when change finally dares to knock, use the too-late fallacy.

42
00:02:27,699 --> 00:02:28,479
I'm 40 now.

43
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,479
It's too late to change my career.

44
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,860
I've been alone so long, I wouldn't know how to be with someone.

45
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:38,300
It's a neat trick staying exactly where you are while feeling like the voice of reason.

46
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,819
The goal, of course, is to become a relic of the self.

47
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,659
A museum devoted to your own past.

48
00:02:45,219 --> 00:02:47,360
You've achieved the ultimate mindset misery.

49
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,819
The inability to change because you're too loyal to the person you used to be.

50
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:55,719
You're the professional mourner at your own funeral and you're doing a magnificent job.

51
00:02:56,699 --> 00:02:59,900
Take the subject from the residence log, April 22.

52
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,020
They're still regretting 2014.

53
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,819
Not just the mistakes, not just the failures every year since,

54
00:03:05,979 --> 00:03:09,599
has been nothing more than a postscript to that one terrible chapter.

55
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,599
They're a prisoner of their own timeline.

56
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:12,840
And the worst part?

57
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:15,479
They don't even realize they're locked in.

58
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,400
A man who cannot change his mind cannot change anything.

59
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,879
And a man who cannot change his personality,

60
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,000
he's finally, truly, safely stuck.

61
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,039
A man who can change his personality,

62
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:30,659
a woman who has seen that look.

63
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:40,659
A man who has committed to the

64
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,120
his knowledge of the nature,

65
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,159
his species behind him because of his mutta'...

66
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,400
about eternity.
