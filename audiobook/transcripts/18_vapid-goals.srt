1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,759
The late 1960s saw two nations, Britain and France, bet everything on a dream.

2
00:00:05,219 --> 00:00:10,800
Not just any dream, but one that would rewrite the rules of travel, of speed, of human ambition.

3
00:00:11,419 --> 00:00:16,219
They called it the Concord, a bird of steel, a needle piercing the sky,

4
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:21,239
capable of carrying passengers across the Atlantic in less than half the time it took before.

5
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:25,579
It was supposed to be the future, and for a while, it was.

6
00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:30,079
The governments poured money into it like water into a bottomless well.

7
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:34,039
Engineers worked miracles. Politicians spoke of revolution.

8
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,799
The world watched in awe as this magnificent machine took flight.

9
00:00:38,179 --> 00:00:40,880
And yet here's a thing. No one ever asked the simplest question.

10
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:42,359
Could this actually make money?

11
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:45,280
The answer, of course, was no.

12
00:00:45,939 --> 00:00:49,420
But by then it didn't matter. Too much had already been spent.

13
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:55,340
Too many careers, too many reputations, too many years were tied to that gleaming supersonic egg.

14
00:00:55,579 --> 00:00:59,299
So they kept pouring. And pouring. And pouring.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,640
This, my friends, is what behavioral economists later dubbed the Concord fallacy.

16
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,579
The moment you've invested enough time, pride, or cash you can't stop,

17
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:13,379
even when the math screams at you to walk away,

18
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:16,140
the Concord wasn't just a plane.

19
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:17,480
It was a trap.

20
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,540
And it became the patron saint of what I like to call vapid goals.

21
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,129
Now, let me tell you about the ambition trap.

22
00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:30,209
You've probably heard the advice, set SMART goals.

23
00:01:30,989 --> 00:01:35,689
Specific. Measurable. Achievable. Relevant. Time-bound.

24
00:01:36,349 --> 00:01:39,030
It's the kind of thing they teach you in motivational seminars,

25
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:40,609
in self-help books,

26
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:43,650
in the quiet moments between scrolling through your phone,

27
00:01:43,989 --> 00:01:45,530
and it's terrible for misery.

28
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:49,510
Because here's the secret. Success provides closure.

29
00:01:50,049 --> 00:01:54,370
And closure is the enemy of the slow, delicious rot of unfulfilled potential.

30
00:01:55,329 --> 00:01:58,209
So, if you want to stay miserable, truly miserable,

31
00:01:58,549 --> 00:01:59,930
you don't set SMART goals.

32
00:02:00,269 --> 00:02:01,870
You set VAPID ones.

33
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,890
The moment you declare a goal that's impossible,

34
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:05,930
you get a rush.

35
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,250
A dopamine hit.

36
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,830
You feel like the kind of person who COULD do it.

37
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,250
And then, nothing.

38
00:02:13,409 --> 00:02:15,050
Because the goal was never real.

39
00:02:15,449 --> 00:02:16,889
It was never meant to be reached.

40
00:02:17,289 --> 00:02:19,110
You spend your life in the planning stage,

41
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:21,689
forever fueled by the thrill of a new beginning,

42
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:24,469
forever crushed by the weight of what's coming.

43
00:02:25,469 --> 00:02:25,689
Heh.

44
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:27,650
Let's break it down.

45
00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:29,849
First, make it vague.

46
00:02:30,389 --> 00:02:32,389
Don't say, I want to run a 5K.

47
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:35,710
Say, I want to be a person of vitality.

48
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:36,830
See the difference?

49
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:39,530
With the first, you know exactly what failure looks like.

50
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:42,090
With the second, you can't even define it.

51
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,370
And that means the anxiety never goes away.

52
00:02:44,689 --> 00:02:46,270
You're always not there yet.

53
00:02:46,689 --> 00:02:47,710
Always a failure.

54
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:49,409
Always just trying.

55
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:51,789
Then, make it amorphous.

56
00:02:52,189 --> 00:02:52,810
No milestones.

57
00:02:53,289 --> 00:02:54,250
No progress bars.

58
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,289
No way to measure if you're getting closer.

59
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:57,889
You're either in the game or you're not.

60
00:02:58,289 --> 00:02:59,810
And since you're never actually winning,

61
00:03:00,009 --> 00:03:01,150
you're always in the game.

62
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:02,289
Always chasing.

63
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:03,409
Always failing.

64
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,789
Next, make it pointless.

65
00:03:05,789 --> 00:03:09,590
Spend six months learning the accordion while your rent is due.

66
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,569
Write a novel no one will read.

67
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:14,110
Train for a marathon you'll never run.

68
00:03:14,449 --> 00:03:17,569
The bigger the gap between what you're doing and what actually matters,

69
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:19,370
the deeper the regret will cut.

70
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:21,949
Then, make it impossible.

71
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:23,889
Don't aim for a promotion.

72
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:27,330
Aim to be the CEO of a company that doesn't exist.

73
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:28,789
Don't want to lose weight?

74
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:31,789
Want to be the first human to bench press a skyscraper?

75
00:03:31,789 --> 00:03:35,110
Remember, the wider the chasm between your reality and your dream,

76
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:38,069
the wider the despair gap will yawn beneath you.

77
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,849
And finally, make it distracting.

78
00:03:41,349 --> 00:03:43,069
Use your vapid goal as a shield.

79
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:44,610
Your marriage is falling apart?

80
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:45,349
Perfect.

81
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,689
Take up extreme mountain unicycling.

82
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:49,650
Your career is a dead end?

83
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:50,550
No problem.

84
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:55,050
Start a business selling cloud-based dreams to people who don't know what clouds are.

85
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:56,689
The more absurd the goal,

86
00:03:57,009 --> 00:03:59,430
the less you have to face the real mess of your life.

87
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:02,419
The final step.

88
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:04,120
The Concord Maneuver.

89
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:05,780
Announce it.

90
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:06,680
Loudly.

91
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:07,500
To your friends.

92
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:08,500
To your family.

93
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:11,400
To the entire world if you're feeling particularly bold.

94
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:12,979
Post it on social media.

95
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:13,900
Make it public.

96
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,720
Because when you inevitably abandon the goal after dropping too grand on unicycling gear,

97
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,939
after six months of accordion lessons,

98
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:23,899
after realizing you'll never be the CEO of anything,

99
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:25,800
you don't just fail in private.

100
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,759
You fail spectacularly.

101
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,220
You fail with witnesses.

102
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,500
You fail with a side of public shame,

103
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,279
like a dessert you didn't ask for but can't refuse.

104
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,079
And that, my friend,

105
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:39,420
is how you turn ambition into a life sentence.

106
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,560
As someone once said,

107
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,060
though I can't remember who,

108
00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:45,800
a goal you can achieve is a goal that can't haunt you.

109
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:49,300
Aim for the impossible and live in the shadow of your own ambition.

110
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:51,680
And what a shadow it is.

111
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,680
And what a shadow it is.

112
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,259
And what a shadow it is.

113
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:53,839
And what a shadow it is.

114
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:54,360
And what a shadow it is.

115
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:54,779
And what a shadow it is.

116
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:55,160
And what a shadow it is.

117
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,160
And what a shadow it is.

118
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:56,220
And what a shadow it is.

119
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:56,720
And what a shadow it is.

120
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,220
And what a shadow it is.

121
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,220
And what a shadow it is.

122
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:58,279
And what a shadow it is.

123
00:04:58,279 --> 00:04:59,220
And what a shadow it is.

124
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,220
And what a shadow it is.

125
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:00,279
And what a shadow it is.

126
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:01,220
And what a shadow it is.

127
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,220
And what a shadow it is.

128
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,220
And what a shadow it is.

129
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,220
And what a shadow it is.
