1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,540
The patent offices of the late 19th century were drowning in them, men who had spent their

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:09,599
fortunes on machines that never worked. Not a single one would admit failure. Instead,

3
00:00:09,939 --> 00:00:14,859
they produced ledgers, thick with names, the investors who betrayed them, the rivals who

4
00:00:14,859 --> 00:00:19,980
sabotaged their designs, the families who never believed. Their lives weren't about what they'd

5
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:26,480
built. They were about who had stopped them. This, my friend, is the art of the resume of

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:32,600
regrets. Cognitive psychologists call it counterfactual thinking, the habit of haunting

7
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:39,820
the past with what-ifs. Most people use it to learn. The maven. The maven uses it to stay stuck,

8
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:44,719
because there's a difference between asking what went wrong and asking who kept me from winning.

9
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:51,539
One leads to growth. The other leads to a lifetime of righteous indignation. And the maven always

10
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:58,039
chooses the latter. Now consider the omission bias that sneaky trick the brain plays where we punish

11
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:05,180
action more than inaction. If you didn't apply for that promotion, you didn't fail. You didn't act.

12
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:11,379
And in the maven's world, inaction is purity. It's the only way to live in a fantasy where success

13
00:01:11,379 --> 00:01:16,120
is always just one almost away. Here's how it's done.

14
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:22,680
First, you collect your pivot archive. Every job you left becomes a masterpiece of foresight.

15
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:29,780
I quit before they went public. My manager just didn't get me. The ego stays untouched. The bank

16
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:35,840
account, well, that's just collateral damage. Anti-fragile, they say. Or at least, that's what

17
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:42,140
you tell yourself when the rents do. Then there's the ghost networker roster of former colleagues who've

18
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:47,680
climbed higher than you. Their success isn't inspiration. It's proof of your own bad luck.

19
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,260
If I'd stayed at X, I'd be where Y is now. Chronological comparison, the maven's favorite

20
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:57,560
game. Because why measure yourself against the present when you can measure yourself against

21
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:04,879
a past that never was? And then, oh, then there's the perfect opportunity mirage. You're not just

22
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:11,360
waiting for the right job. You're waiting for the perfect job. Any real chance is rejected with a

23
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:19,139
sigh. Not quite the right fit. The timing wasn't right. The maven never moves. They just stand in

24
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:26,099
the hallway of potential, forever auditioning for a life that will never call. Finally, the resume of

25
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:33,159
excuses. Never speak of what you did. Only what you couldn't. I had the idea for Uber in 2005. The

26
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:39,939
funding just wasn't there. The maven doesn't build careers. They build alibis. And the best alibis are the

27
00:02:39,939 --> 00:02:47,219
ones no one can disprove. The result? You become a human afterthought. Not a person who lived, but a

28
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:53,219
person who almost did. Your history isn't written in the past tense. It's written in the past conditional.

29
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:00,680
You would have been great. You should have been rich. You could have been happy. And now, you're just a

30
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:07,939
footnote in someone else's success story. Take a subject from the Residence Log, October 29th. They're

31
00:03:07,939 --> 00:03:14,120
still there. Still at the job they hate. Every day they stay is another line on their resume of regrets.

32
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:20,539
Because the hardest thing to bury isn't failure. It's the life you didn't live. And the maven?

33
00:03:21,099 --> 00:03:27,659
The maven keeps the shovel handy. Always digging. Always ready to prove that the only thing standing

34
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:31,439
between you and greatness was, well, someone else.
