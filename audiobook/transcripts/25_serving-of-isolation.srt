1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,280
The late 60s brought us a revelation, one that should have been obvious all along.

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:09,240
Psychologists John Darley and Bib Latane locked people in rooms,

3
00:00:09,699 --> 00:00:13,019
staged emergencies, and watched something strange unfold.

4
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:16,100
The more witnesses there were, the less anyone moved.

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,359
A woman collapsed.

6
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:18,620
Screams went up.

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,620
And yet no one called for help.

8
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:22,300
Not because they were cruel.

9
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,739
Because the responsibility had been divided into so many pieces,

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,260
each person thought someone else would handle it.

11
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:30,679
Diffusion of responsibility.

12
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,140
A beautiful thing if you're aiming for solitude.

13
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,299
Now, let's talk about real isolation.

14
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:39,600
Not the kind you get by fleeing to a cabin in the woods, though.

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,899
Honestly, that's just a Romantics fantasy.

16
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:45,500
True isolation isn't about distance.

17
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,700
It's about presence.

18
00:00:47,259 --> 00:00:51,700
It's about standing in the middle of a crowded room and making sure no one ever touches you.

19
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:53,320
The Sentinelize Maneuver.

20
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:56,799
A technique borrowed from the tribes of North Sentinel Island,

21
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:00,039
who've spent millennia perfecting the art of being left alone.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,200
You see, isolation isn't passive.

23
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,379
It's a strategy.

24
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:09,579
The world is full of nudges, social media pings, forced team-building exercises,

25
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,700
the relentless optimism of people who actually enjoy other humans.

26
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:16,439
To stay untouched, you have to fight back.

27
00:01:16,819 --> 00:01:18,439
You have to turn the city into an island.

28
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,420
First, there's the digital trench.

29
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,400
Your phone isn't just a tool, it's a shield.

30
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,579
In any public space, keep the scream between you and the world.

31
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:29,920
A flickering glow.

32
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:31,420
A distracted stare.

33
00:01:31,939 --> 00:01:32,579
It's a signal.

34
00:01:33,019 --> 00:01:33,780
Do not approach.

35
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,579
The bystander effect works in reverse.

36
00:01:37,219 --> 00:01:38,260
No one will help you.

37
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,980
And more importantly, no one will bother you.

38
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:43,719
Then, there's the I'm fine glaze.

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,719
A neutral tone.

40
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:46,719
A room temperature reply.

41
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:50,400
If someone asks how you are, you don't expand.

42
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,120
You don't invite them in.

43
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,700
Details are hooks.

44
00:01:54,379 --> 00:01:55,799
Conversations are traps.

45
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:57,459
Stay frictionless.

46
00:01:57,459 --> 00:02:00,359
Next, the diffusion of plans.

47
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,379
When invited somewhere, give the vague affirmative.

48
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:04,819
That sounds interesting.

49
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,680
I'll let you know.

50
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,099
Then, don't.

51
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,300
Leave them hanging.

52
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:09,699
A little anxiety.

53
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,479
A hint of unreliability.

54
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:13,719
Soon, your name carries a weight stress.

55
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:14,759
Inconvenience.

56
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,759
The faint scent of a bad investment.

57
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:20,199
And if someone still dares to breach your defenses.

58
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,800
Garnish the interaction with the heavy sigh.

59
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:23,979
The door slam.

60
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,419
The unspoken, you're wasting my time.

61
00:02:26,419 --> 00:02:29,379
Make it clear you are not here to be engaged.

62
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:32,020
Now consider the public diner.

63
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,780
A master class in the Sentinelese Maneuver.

64
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:35,960
A book.

65
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:37,699
A neutral gaze.

66
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:41,000
A single person in a crowded bistro, untouchable.

67
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:42,560
The others see you.

68
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:43,939
They acknowledge you.

69
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,479
But they don't reach out.

70
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,560
Because you've made it impossible.

71
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:49,580
And that's the goal.

72
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:50,740
Alone, together.

73
00:02:51,259 --> 00:02:53,539
Physically present, psychologically untouchable.

74
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:56,400
The ultimate social achievement being invisible.

75
00:02:56,419 --> 00:02:57,599
In plain sight.

76
00:02:58,539 --> 00:03:00,099
A wall of stone can be climbed.

77
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:01,400
A wall of indifference.

78
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,340
That's the only one that lasts.
