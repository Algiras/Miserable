00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,660
The year was 1982, and two social scientists, James Q. Wilson and George L. Kelling, had just

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,460
given the world a theory that would explain more than just why neighborhoods crumble.

3
00:00:10,939 --> 00:00:17,300
They called it the Broken Window Theory. Picture it, a single pane of glass, cracked and ignored,

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:24,260
left there, unnoticed, unfixed, and then, oh, then something shifts. The next window goes,

5
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:30,559
then the next, graffiti appears. Doors stay unlocked. Before you know it, the whole street

6
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:36,280
has surrendered to decay. But here's the thing about Broken Windows. They don't just rot buildings.

7
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:42,679
They rot relationships, and not the dramatic kind, the kind that end with screaming matches or slamming

8
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:47,579
doors. No, these are the quiet ones, the ones that fade like a photograph left in the sun.

9
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:54,240
We don't lose the people we love over grand betrayals. We lose them over the unreturned

10
00:00:54,240 --> 00:01:02,079
texts, the forgotten birthdays. The way we let a joke linger too long, unanswered. Each one is a

11
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:09,239
crack in the glass, and once the first one appears, the rest follow. Now, let's talk about how to

12
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:14,840
accelerate the process. Because if you're truly committed to misery, you don't just let the windows

13
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:22,400
break by accident. You shatter them deliberately. First, there's the unreturned text. A friend reaches

14
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,739
out, maybe they're hurting. Maybe they just need to hear your voice. You see the notification. You

15
00:01:27,739 --> 00:01:35,060
know it's there. And you do nothing. Three days pass. Then you reply, cold as a winter morning.

16
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:40,680
Sorry. Been busy. That's the first window. And once it's broken, the rest will follow.

17
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,920
Then comes the selective memory. Ever had an argument where you suddenly remember everything

18
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:52,780
the other person has ever done wrong. The one time they forgot your anniversary. The way they laughed

19
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:58,340
at your joke, that joke. The one you told in 2018. You dredge it all up, polished and sharp,

20
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,560
while their years of kindness vanish like smoke. That's the second window. And it shatters.

21
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:08,699
Next, the public slight. A misplaced fact, corrected in front of witnesses.

22
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:15,280
Actually, that movie came out in 94. A trivial error, but now it's out there.

23
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:21,439
A stain on the reputation of trust. The third window. And with each correction,

24
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,560
the graffiti of doubt spreads a little wider. Finally, the fixed mindset label. Someone tries

25
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:33,060
to change. Someone dares to grow. You pin them down with their past. You've always been like this.

26
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:38,560
And just like that, the door stays locked. The neighborhood empties. The silence settles in.

27
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,419
The genius of the broken window theory? It doesn't require force. No grand gestures.

28
00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:49,759
No dramatic confrontations. You just let the decay happen. And soon, your friends,

29
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:53,360
your neighbors will realize a property value of your company has plummeted.

30
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:58,719
They'll walk away. One by one. Until you're left standing in the ruins of your own design.

31
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,460
A master of the social ghost town.

32
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,740
And the best part? You didn't even have to do the kicking out. The windows did it for you.

33
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:11,240
A single unrepaired slight is the beginning of a magnificent silence.

34
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:11,719
You just let the

35
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:13,620
That sky or whatever the fancy talent is.

36
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,599
Just so there's nothing to do. Forgain out there.

37
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:14,620
First humans.

38
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:27,699
Like the

39
00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:28,819
First humans.

40
00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:30,500
Like the

41
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,939
avalence.

42
00:03:31,939 --> 00:03:33,560
Like the

43
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,860
To
