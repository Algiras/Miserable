1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,240
The year was the 1990s, and somewhere in the quiet corners of academia, an anthropologist named Robin Dunbar made a discovery that would later become the foundation for a particularly ruthless philosophy.

2
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,660
He found that human brains have a hard limit about 150 people.

3
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:18,820
That's it. No more. No less.

4
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:26,280
Beyond that number, relationships fray, trust weakens, and the delicate fabric of social connection begins to unravel.

5
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:29,920
Now, most people would look at that number and think of community.

6
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,579
A village, if you will.

7
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:41,079
A network of people who lean on one another in hard times, who return favors without ledgers, who forgive the small slights that life inevitably throws their way.

8
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:44,880
But we? We see something else entirely.

9
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,780
We see a ledger.

10
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:56,219
Not the kind with ink and parchment, but something far more insidious, a mental tally of every unpaid debt, every favor left unreturned.

11
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,899
Every moment of perceived imbalance.

12
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,240
This is what we call the social ledger.

13
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:11,260
And if you're clever, if you're patient, you can use it to dismantle every relationship in your life until you stand alone, untouchable, the sovereign of nothing.

14
00:01:12,219 --> 00:01:13,379
The first step is simple.

15
00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:15,500
You must become an accountant of misery.

16
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,560
Most people live in a world where social grace is the default.

17
00:01:20,019 --> 00:01:21,840
They forget who bought the last coffee.

18
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,579
They overlook the fact that they carried the entire group project on their shoulders while someone else took the credit.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,599
They let small offenses slip, buried beneath the weight of goodwill.

20
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:32,519
But that?

21
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,480
That is a catastrophic failure of bookkeeping.

22
00:01:36,099 --> 00:01:42,159
If you want your world to be a place of friction, not comfort, you must adopt what we call resentment accounting.

23
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,799
The process begins with memory.

24
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:50,299
Not just any memory the kind that lingers, sharp and precise, like a needle in your mind.

25
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:52,019
Every time a friend is late.

26
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:54,780
Every time a partner forgets to take out the trash.

27
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:59,760
Every time a colleague steals your idea and passes it off as their own you recorded.

28
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,420
Not in the moment.

29
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:02,500
Oh no.

30
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:04,299
That would be too obvious.

31
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:06,579
You save it, you let it ferment.

32
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:13,900
You wait for the perfect opportunity, the peak of an argument, the height of emotional tension, and then you strike.

33
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:16,479
This is what we call peak-end engineering.

34
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,020
The first part of the story is just setup.

35
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:20,020
The payoff?

36
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:22,180
That's where the real damage happens.

37
00:02:23,139 --> 00:02:24,699
But memory alone isn't enough.

38
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:27,840
You must also turn every interaction into a transaction.

39
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,879
Need a cup of sugar from your neighbor?

40
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:31,439
Don't just hand it over.

41
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:33,520
Calculate the market value of the sugar.

42
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,680
Factor in the labor cost of your time.

43
00:02:36,139 --> 00:02:38,039
Make them feel the weight of the exchange.

44
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:45,599
The moment you remove the grease of reciprocity, the moment you turn every act of kindness into a debt, you've already won.

45
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,599
Because now, every favor is a ledger entry.

46
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,400
And every ledger entry is a potential weapon.

47
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,400
And then there's trust.

48
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:55,639
Or rather, the absence of it.

49
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:59,960
You must approach every relationship as if it were a game of the prisoner's dilemma.

50
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,219
Always assume the other person will betray you.

51
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,719
So you betray them first.

52
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:05,680
You ghost.

53
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,680
You cancel.

54
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,319
You spread that little rumor.

55
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,500
Just enough to make them question whether they can trust you at all.

56
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:14,500
By being the first to defect, you protect yourself.

57
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:17,300
But you'll also burn the village down around you.

58
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:23,599
Because trust, once broken, is a fire that doesn't just consume the relationship it consumes everything else, too.

59
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,439
Finally, there's the matter of Dunbar's number itself.

60
00:03:27,939 --> 00:03:32,099
Most people try to expand their circle to welcome more people into their lives.

61
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:32,900
But you?

62
00:03:33,259 --> 00:03:34,300
You do the opposite.

63
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,759
You keep your number low not by being selective, but by being unbearable.

64
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:42,400
You apply the broken window theory in reverse.

65
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,719
The moment someone enters your orbit, you let them see the cracks.

66
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,280
A forgotten birthday.

67
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,340
A half-hearted apology.

68
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,900
A single instance of disrespect left unrepaired.

69
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:57,740
And just like that, they'll start to wonder if they even belong there in the first place.

70
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:00,840
Before long, your village will shrink to nothing.

71
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:01,819
And you?

72
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:07,240
You'll be left standing in the ruins, the undisputed king of a world with no one in it.

73
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,840
The goal, after all, is simple.

74
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,400
Social autonomy.

75
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:12,939
No debts owed.

76
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:14,419
No debts to collect.

77
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:19,180
Just you, standing alone, untethered from the weight of obligation.

78
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,019
A debt forgiven is a connection maintained.

79
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,519
But a debt recorded?

80
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,420
That's a bridge ready to be burned.

81
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:27,459
And when the last one is gone?

82
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:30,959
Well, that's when you truly begin to reign.
