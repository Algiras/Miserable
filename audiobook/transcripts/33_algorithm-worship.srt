1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,940
The pigeons in B.F. Skinner's box didn't just peck at a lever, they became fanatics.

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:13,140
Starved for certainty, they threw themselves against the glass, desperate for the next crumb, even when the food never came.

3
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:17,239
Skinner called it intermittent reinforcement. We call it addiction.

4
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,940
And now, we're the pigeons.

5
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:24,239
The lever is the for-you feed. The box is the screen.

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,440
The crumbs, whatever the algorithm decides to drop into our laps at random.

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,480
We don't even know what we're hungry for anymore. The machine does.

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,880
This is algorithm worship, the slow surrender of your mind to a recommendation engine.

9
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,780
You don't choose what you watch. You don't choose what you think.

10
00:00:41,299 --> 00:00:46,060
The algorithm does. And it doesn't care about truth. It cares about you.

11
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,039
It starts with serendipity's death.

12
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:57,100
Remember the old days, when you stumbled upon a song on the radio or a book in a dusty corner of a shop, and it changed you?

13
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,939
That was chance. Now, chance is a crime.

14
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,760
Algorithms don't want you to discover anything unexpected.

15
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:13,680
They want you trapped in a filter, bubble a digital womb, where every thought, every image, every outrage is tailored to confirm what you already believe.

16
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:17,780
Personalization? No. Intellectual claustrophobia.

17
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,180
You're not being served. You're being optimized.

18
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,219
Here's how it works.

19
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,560
First, you stop searching.

20
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,180
You never type a single word into that bar.

21
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,620
You just click the first thing the algorithm shoves in front of you.

22
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,060
Let it decide.

23
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,200
Before long, you forget what you actually like.

24
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:38,239
The machine knows better than you do.

25
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,780
Then, you feed the outrage.

26
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,420
The angrier you get, the more it gives you.

27
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,120
Every like, every share,

28
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,620
every furious reply.

29
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:47,819
It's all data.

30
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:49,900
The algorithm doesn't want you to think.

31
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:51,239
It wants you reacting.

32
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,400
You're not questioning.

33
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,719
And if you're reacting, you're not questioning.

34
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:55,799
You're not growing.

35
00:01:56,299 --> 00:01:59,180
You're just another data point in a never-ending loop of conflict.

36
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,680
Next, you purge the dissent.

37
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:03,760
If someone disagrees with you,

38
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,840
mute, block, delete.

39
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,640
Your feed becomes a mirror,

40
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,979
reflecting only your own voice polished,

41
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:11,460
amplified, safe.

42
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,219
No contradictions allowed.

43
00:02:13,539 --> 00:02:14,319
No surprises.

44
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,419
Just the echo of your own certainty,

45
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,060
growing louder with every like.

46
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,819
Finally, you worship the metrics.

47
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,259
If the algorithm doesn't boost your post,

48
00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:24,520
that's not a glitch.

49
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:25,620
That's failure.

50
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,400
Your worth isn't measured in ideas anymore.

51
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,219
It's measured in engagement,

52
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:31,620
in shares,

53
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,000
in time spent.

54
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:35,319
The numbers are your God.

55
00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:36,479
And the algorithm?

56
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,020
It's the high priest,

57
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,340
whispering in your ear,

58
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,620
you're not enough.

59
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,020
But we can fix that.

60
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,240
And what do you get in the end?

61
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,680
An optimized consumer.

62
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:48,259
You're predictable.

63
00:02:48,699 --> 00:02:49,340
You're engaged.

64
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,680
You're profitable.

65
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,080
You're a ghost in the machine

66
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,000
known better than you know yourself,

67
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:57,340
fed just enough to keep you pecking,

68
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,379
just enough to keep you there.

69
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:02,120
The algorithm doesn't want you to be happy.

70
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,439
It wants you to be present,

71
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,599
always present,

72
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,680
always clicking,

73
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,319
always waiting for the next drop of dopamine,

74
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,039
the next scrap of validation.

75
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:12,259
Doomscrolling for breakfast,

76
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:12,979
lunch,

77
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:13,620
dinner.

78
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,400
The algorithm sets your baseline

79
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,659
before you even wake up.

80
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,340
Addicted,

81
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,560
that's the default now.

82
00:03:19,539 --> 00:03:20,780
The pigeons in Skinner's box

83
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,800
never learn to stop.

84
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,979
Neither will you.

85
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,979
Because the lever doesn't just give you food.

86
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,479
It gives you nothing at all.
