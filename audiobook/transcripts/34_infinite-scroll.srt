1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,740
The Greeks had a punishment for the clever eternity pushing a boulder uphill, only to watch it roll back down.

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:11,980
Sisyphus, pointless, exhausting, and yet, somehow, he was the one who got the story.

3
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:14,140
Now we have our own version.

4
00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:16,660
It's called the Infinite Scroll.

5
00:00:17,739 --> 00:00:26,460
No beginning, no end, just the slow, creeping realization that you've been here for hours and the screen keeps going and the boulder never stops.

6
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:30,719
The labor movements of the early 1900s would have loved this.

7
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:39,659
They saw the assembly line, the same endless motion, the same hollow satisfaction of a job well done, only to have it all undone the next day.

8
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,060
But at least the factory whistle blew.

9
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:43,579
At least the shift ended.

10
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:50,700
At least there was a clock to punch, a paycheck to collect, a moment to step outside and remember you are still alive.

11
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,640
The Infinite Scroll does none of that.

12
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,439
It dissolves time itself.

13
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,939
Human beings need markers.

14
00:00:59,359 --> 00:00:59,840
A start.

15
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:00,880
A finish.

16
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,060
A stop.

17
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:03,420
But the Infinite Scroll?

18
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:04,920
It has no stop.

19
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:10,120
It has only next, and next, and next, so you don't notice the hours slipping away.

20
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,620
You don't feel the weight of the boulder in your hands.

21
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:13,939
You just keep scrolling.

22
00:01:15,019 --> 00:01:16,719
And here's the thing you tell yourself.

23
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,040
It's just one more.

24
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,519
One more post.

25
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:20,920
One more article.

26
00:01:21,379 --> 00:01:22,340
One more video.

27
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,079
But the screen knows better.

28
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:25,519
It's designed to lie.

29
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,239
Because there is always another.

30
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,519
Always another.

31
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,459
And so, you never stop.

32
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:32,719
Some people call it meditation.

33
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:34,540
They watch the colors blur.

34
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:35,599
The shapes shift.

35
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:36,760
The feed refresh.

36
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,799
Their thumbs move like prayer beads.

37
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:40,219
Their eyes glaze over.

38
00:01:40,219 --> 00:01:43,019
They've mastered sedentary mastery.

39
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:46,060
The art of doing nothing while pretending to be productive.

40
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:47,260
The thumb cramp.

41
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:48,239
A badge of honor.

42
00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:49,239
The dry eyes.

43
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,219
Proof you've earned your place in the digital catacombs.

44
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:55,599
And then there's the real trick-the-sump cost of attention.

45
00:01:56,099 --> 00:01:57,280
You've already spent an hour.

46
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:58,739
Might as well spend two.

47
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:00,219
Might as well spend three.

48
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,159
Because what's another hour when you're already in?

49
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:04,780
You're gambling now.

50
00:02:05,019 --> 00:02:05,599
Not with money.

51
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,099
With your own focus.

52
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,780
And the house always wins.

53
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,259
The goal?

54
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:11,860
To turn you into a ghost.

55
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,539
Not a spirit.

56
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,780
Not a memory.

57
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,639
A ghost of the interface.

58
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:18,599
Sitting in a room.

59
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:20,300
Staring at a three-inch window.

60
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,159
While the world outside fades into static.

61
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,180
You've spent a lifetime looking.

62
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:27,080
But you've never really seen anything.

63
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:28,159
And the screen?

64
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,259
It's just waiting.

65
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:30,400
Always waiting.

66
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,460
For the next click.

67
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,580
Some people optimize it.

68
00:02:33,939 --> 00:02:35,060
They call it doom-scrolling.

69
00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:36,699
They feed the outrage.

70
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,219
They chase the next outrage.

71
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,139
They turn the infinite scroll into a perpetual motion machine of despair.

72
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,180
A book has a last page.

73
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,120
A screen has only a next page.

74
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,800
And the next page is always the same.

75
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,539
Choose wisely.
