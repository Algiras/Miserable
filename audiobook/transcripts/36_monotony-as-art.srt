00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,700
The late seventeenth century had its own peculiar kind of heresy one that didn't burn at the stake,

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:11,599
but festered in the soul. Quietism, they called it. A doctrine so radical it dared to suggest

3
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:16,960
that salvation lay not in prayer or penance, but in doing nothing at all. Not the passive

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,899
resignation of a martyr, but the deliberate erasure of self. Imagine it. A life so stripped

5
00:00:22,899 --> 00:00:28,839
of motion, of choice, of even the faintest whisper of desire, that you became less a person than a

6
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:36,500
shadow cast by one. And here's the thing it worked. We call it monotony, as art. Because misery,

7
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:43,399
like fine wine, benefits from aging. But not just any aging. The kind that requires no effort,

8
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:49,840
no risk, no deviation from the script, a high-variance life travel, new flavors, the occasional

9
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:57,039
jolt of the unexpected, is a life that thrives on chaos. It's anti-fragile, as they say in the trade,

10
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:04,040
but you, you want the opposite. You want the slow, surgical removal of all possibility.

11
00:01:04,579 --> 00:01:09,579
You want a world so perfectly gray that even your own existence becomes a background hum,

12
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:16,299
something you barely register anymore. The brain you see is a traitor. It's wired to ignore what

13
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:22,180
doesn't change. That's why you stop noticing the clutter on your desk. Why the hum of your computer

14
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:28,540
fades into silence. Why after a while, even the air you breathe stops feeling like air at all.

15
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:35,299
It's called habituation the brain's way of conserving energy by checking out entirely. And if you

16
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:42,200
engineer your life just right, you can habituate to everything. Start with the uniform of indifference.

17
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:48,859
Breakfast, lunch, same thing, every day. No variations. No surprises. Your body stops craving.

18
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:54,459
Your mind stops wandering. Then the clothes. The same style. The same colors. The same texture

19
00:01:54,459 --> 00:02:00,719
against your skin. No new sensations. No accidental pleasures. You're not dressing anymore. You're

20
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:08,479
wearing the cage. Next, the routine fortress. 15-minute increments mapped out in advance. No detours.

21
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:16,580
No spontaneous walks. No what-if moments. Always the same path to work. Always the same pace. And soon,

22
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:22,680
your brain switches off entirely. The commute isn't a journey anymore. It's a dead hour, stretched thin

23
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:29,740
across the day. A masterclass in the art of being absent. Then comes the aesthetics of beige. Your home

24
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:35,819
isn't a place to live. It's a sensory neutral zone. No vibrant colors. No interesting textures.

25
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:42,379
No art that might dare to provoke a thought. Just walls that don't demand attention. Floors that

26
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:47,879
don't whisper. A space so bland that your eyes have nowhere to land. Your mind nowhere to wander.

27
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:55,419
And if, God forbid, something new slips in. A serendipitous encounter. A moment of unexpected

28
00:02:55,419 --> 00:03:01,680
joy. You don't indulge it. You don't let it linger. You categorize it immediately as a distraction.

29
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:08,400
A threat. And you return, swiftly, to the routine. Because every new thing is a crack in the monotony.

30
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:15,900
Every deviation is a betrayal of the gray. The goal? Total habituation. A life so transparent you

31
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:21,280
forget you're alive at all. You exist, but you don't feel it. You're a ghost in your own story.

32
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,939
And that, my friend, is the ultimate aesthetic of misery. The ability to stare into a world of

33
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:32,219
infinite possibility and see nothing but a single, flat, unchanging shade of gray.

34
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:39,319
They wrote about it in the residence log back in March. Indoor air stagnation. The subject refused

35
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:45,759
to open the windows. Kept the temperature locked in place. Even the air they breathed became part of

36
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:51,879
the performance. Because what's a breath, really? Just another sensation to habituate. Another thing

37
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:57,960
to stop noticing. And then there's the prisoner's wisdom. The prisoner who knows the exact number of

38
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:04,360
bars in his cell is the only one who is truly home. Count the bars. How poetic. How efficient.

39
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:10,699
Because in the end, misery isn't about suffering. It's about control. The control of never having to

40
00:04:10,699 --> 00:04:17,100
choose. Never having to wonder. Never having to feel anything at all. Just the slow, steady erosion of

41
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:22,379
self, until all that's left is the quiet hum of a life well spent in gray.
