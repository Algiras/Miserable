1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,599
The 19th century had a name for it, Bibliomania, that feverish urge to collect books you'd never

2
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:12,199
open, not for knowledge, not for understanding, but for the sheer weight of possibility.

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,039
These were not readers, they were curators of a different kind of devotion, the architecture

4
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:23,199
of what might have been. And then there was Tuundoku, the Japanese art of letting books

5
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,780
pile up like unpaid debts, each spine a silent accusation against the life you're actually

6
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:34,420
living. The library becomes a psychological anchor, every unread volume a Zygarnik loop

7
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:39,479
you've willingly installed in your refuge. You don't just avoid the work you perform, the

8
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:45,159
avoidance. The books sit there, judging you in their leather-bound silence. Now, consider

9
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:50,799
the burden of the unopened page. You buy advanced macroeconomics, not because you'll master

10
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:55,439
it, but because the act of purchase makes you feel like the kind of person who could. The

11
00:00:55,439 --> 00:01:00,899
book is a participation trophy for the intellectual life you've only ever imagined. Behavioral

12
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:07,540
economists call it the sunk cost fallacy. But in the library, it's worse. It's the sunk

13
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:13,260
cost of identity. You've already spent the money. You've already claimed the shelf space.

14
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,959
The only thing left is to pretend you're the kind of person who reads. And so the instructions

15
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:25,239
for intellectual overload begin. First, subscribe to every book review newsletter in existence.

16
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:32,079
When a title is labeled essential, groundbreaking, or dense, buy it immediately. Don't read the first

17
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:37,799
page. Just place it at the bottom of a new stack. The recommendation trap is simple. The more you own,

18
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:44,000
the more you can pretend you're keeping up. Then, use those unread books as a backdrop for your video

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,379
calls. Let your colleagues see the aesthetic of your sophistication. The towering spines. The

20
00:01:50,379 --> 00:01:56,739
carefully arranged chaos. Your social identity is built on avoidance coping. And what better proof

21
00:01:56,739 --> 00:02:03,060
of your intellectual rigor than a shelf full of books you'll never touch? Next, convince yourself

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:08,379
these are for reference. Of course you'll need them someday. The visual static of the unread becomes part

23
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:15,159
of your digital wasteland. A quiet hum of potential that never quite materializes. And finally, prioritize

24
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:21,719
the books that are good for you. The ones that will make you feel guilty for not reading them. Your leisure time

25
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:29,219
becomes a masterclass in dead hours, spent staring at a spine instead of actually engaging with a single idea. The

26
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:37,280
result? You become a shawler of the stack. A fortress of unfulfilled potential. The most well-read person in the room

27
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:43,319
without ever having to read a word. A monument to the life you never started. And then there's the nightstand

28
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:49,560
pile. Three dense philosophical texts placed just within reach as you drift off to sleep. The last

29
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:55,180
thing you see before darkness is a reminder of your own intellectualization of avoidance. A book you

30
00:02:55,180 --> 00:03:01,300
haven't read is a friend you haven't betrayed after all. Keep your friends close. Keep your unread books

31
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:07,620
closer. Because in the end, the library isn't about knowledge. It's about the performance of it.

32
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,479
And the performance is always better than the reality.
