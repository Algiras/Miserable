1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,120
There was a time in the smoky backrooms of 18th century London and Paris when Misery had its own social clubs.

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,519
No toasts here, no cheerful clinking of glasses.

3
00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:13,759
These were the Misery Club's secret gatherings where the only rule was this,

4
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,059
never speak of anything pleasant.

5
00:00:16,539 --> 00:00:18,000
A compliment? A fine.

6
00:00:18,339 --> 00:00:20,800
A mention of a successful meal? Another fine.

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,699
The members understood something profound, that the deepest bonds are forged not in warmth,

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,079
but in the shared performance of discomfort.

9
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:32,700
And so we arrive at the modern iteration, the dinner party of discomfort.

10
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:39,259
Most hosts dream of creating memories lauder, connection, the kind of evening that leaves guests sighing.

11
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:40,659
We should do this again.

12
00:00:40,659 --> 00:00:43,740
The Maven, however, has different ambitions.

13
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:50,240
The Maven hosts to create social debt, to turn hospitality into a laboratory of the slight,

14
00:00:50,619 --> 00:00:54,140
to ensure that every guest leaves not just tired but radioactive,

15
00:00:54,140 --> 00:01:00,899
carrying the residue of an evening so carefully engineered that their own home suddenly feels like a refuge by comparison.

16
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,640
The first step?

17
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:04,959
The itrogenics of the invite.

18
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,859
Sociologists have a term for it.

19
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:08,819
Face work.

20
00:01:09,379 --> 00:01:13,760
The effort we all make to save each other's dignity, to smooth over awkwardness,

21
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,799
to pretend we're enjoying the moment.

22
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:20,159
But the dinner party of discomfort demands something far more taxing.

23
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,780
It requires higher resolution face work.

24
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:27,180
You force your guests to labor so hard at being polite smiling through your neglect,

25
00:01:27,579 --> 00:01:28,620
laughing at your jokes.

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,700
That are jokes?

27
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,760
Nodding along as you pretend to listen while your mind is elsewhere.

28
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,859
That by the end of the night, they're not just exhausted, they're changed.

29
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,980
They leave feeling like they've just emerged from a minefield.

30
00:01:40,219 --> 00:01:40,599
And you?

31
00:01:41,019 --> 00:01:42,579
You're the one who laid the charges.

32
00:01:42,579 --> 00:01:45,579
Now the instructions for sabotage.

33
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:48,620
Begin with ambient agitation.

34
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,180
The lighting must be either so harsh it bleaches the room of color,

35
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:55,060
or so dim that plates become shadows on the table.

36
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,420
Play the city's cacophony, not as background noise,

37
00:01:58,819 --> 00:01:59,859
but as a living thing,

38
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,540
a low hum of tension that makes conversation feel like wading through molasses.

39
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:06,700
Every syllable must be strained,

40
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,419
every pause heavy with the unspoken question,

41
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,460
Is this host even here?

42
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,060
Then, the uncurated mix.

43
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,659
Invite people who have nothing in common or worse,

44
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,939
people who have a history of negative filtering with one another.

45
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,860
Watch as the small talk curdles into something far more interesting.

46
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,280
The kind of conversation that doesn't just reveal differences,

47
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,219
but weapon sizes them.

48
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:32,199
Every polite question becomes a landmine.

49
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,560
Every shared silence a trench.

50
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,840
And just like that,

51
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,879
you've turned your living room into a battlefield

52
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:39,919
where the only casualty is their comfort.

53
00:02:40,419 --> 00:02:41,360
The menu?

54
00:02:41,979 --> 00:02:42,699
Minimal effort.

55
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:44,180
Maximal suffering.

56
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,120
Serve food that resists being eaten dishes,

57
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:50,180
so messy they require utensils you haven't provided.

58
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,759
Soups so hot,

59
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:52,919
they scald a tongue.

60
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,599
Pastries that crumble at the slightest touch.

61
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,860
This is the texture of discomfort applied to the plate.

62
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,120
Every bite becomes an act of endurance.

63
00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:03,099
Every forkful a negotiation.

64
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,280
And all the while, you sit there,

65
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,919
perfectly composed,

66
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,139
sipping something bland from a cup

67
00:03:09,139 --> 00:03:11,360
that's just the right temperature, too, right?

68
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,280
But the master stroke?

69
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:14,780
Intermittent support.

70
00:03:15,219 --> 00:03:16,539
Be the most attentive host,

71
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,719
for exactly five minutes refilling glasses,

72
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,139
with the enthusiasm of a man who's just discovered wine.

73
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:25,919
Leaning in with genuine interest before you ghost your own party.

74
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,919
A sudden need to check an email.

75
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,740
A pressing market update.

76
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:30,759
You vanish.

77
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:32,719
And in that moment of absence,

78
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:33,979
something shifts.

79
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,300
The guests exchange glances.

80
00:03:36,979 --> 00:03:37,919
They lean in closer.

81
00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:39,139
They begin to wonder,

82
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,879
where do I stand in this host's social ledger?

83
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,800
The Zegarnik loop takes hold.

84
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,000
The unanswered question gnaws at them.

85
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:46,699
And you?

86
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:48,139
You're already back,

87
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,259
smiling faintly,

88
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,479
as if nothing happened.

89
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:51,919
The result?

90
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:53,180
The social void.

91
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,719
You've turned your home into a place

92
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:57,180
where you are surrounded by people,

93
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,719
yet utterly alone.

94
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:00,280
Not in the way of a hermit,

95
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:01,819
but in the way of a man

96
00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:04,319
who has perfected the architecture of anxiety.

97
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:07,060
Your guests will leave buzzing about the evening

98
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,500
how fascinating you were,

99
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:10,800
how unlike anyone else you are.

100
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,800
They'll tell their friends about the host

101
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,400
who made them feel seen,

102
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:17,720
who made them work for every moment of connection.

103
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,699
And they'll all secretly hope

104
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:21,019
they never have to come back.

105
00:04:21,939 --> 00:04:24,079
Because the maven doesn't just host a dinner.

106
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,139
The maven,

107
00:04:25,459 --> 00:04:26,740
we programs the guest.

108
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,660
Consider the awkward silence.

109
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:31,500
It's not just a pause.

110
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:32,879
It's a currency.

111
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,139
In the residence log from December of last year,

112
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,680
the subject demonstrates this perfectly.

113
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:40,600
A guest tells a joke.

114
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,160
It falls flat.

115
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,639
Instead of laughing,

116
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:45,220
face the maven does nothing.

117
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,300
No smile.

118
00:04:46,779 --> 00:04:47,459
No nod.

119
00:04:47,899 --> 00:04:50,300
Just a slow, deliberate sip of water.

120
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:51,819
And in that silence,

121
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:53,459
something irreversible happens.

122
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,939
The guest now owes the maven.

123
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,259
Social credit.

124
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,240
Liquidated in real time.

125
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,660
A debt that can be called in years later,

126
00:05:01,899 --> 00:05:02,459
with interest.

127
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:05,259
A good host makes you feel at home.

128
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,379
A maven makes you realize

129
00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:08,579
why you hate being home.

130
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:09,819
Be the maven.
