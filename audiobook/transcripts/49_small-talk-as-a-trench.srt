00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,900
There was a time in the gilded cages of Parisian salons when Wit had a name, Esprit d'Escalier,

2
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:11,439
the clever remark you only thought of after the door had closed behind you.

3
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:18,760
The maven, of course, saw it differently, not as a failure of timing, but as a triumph of self-preservation.

4
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:27,480
By never risking the deep thing, you shielded your fragile ego from the kind of scrutiny that might expose the hollow center of your own existence.

5
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,559
And so, conversation became a trench.

6
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:40,539
Not a bridge, not a path to connection, but a fortified position where you could stand just close enough to be present, just far enough to remain invisible.

7
00:00:41,179 --> 00:00:45,479
The weather, the traffic, the endless churn of the news these were your weapons.

8
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:52,479
Safe topics, like safe distances, ensuring no one ever reached the void where your actual self might lurk.

9
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,039
The digital wasteland had taught you well.

10
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,380
The surface was the only place to live.

11
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,500
The illusion of depth was your greatest tool.

12
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:07,739
Psychologists call it explanatory depth, our delusion that we understand the world better than we do.

13
00:01:08,379 --> 00:01:09,799
The maven weaponized it.
