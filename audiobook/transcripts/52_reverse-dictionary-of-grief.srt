1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,660
Let me tell you about the reverse dictionary of grief, because if there's one thing the maven understands, it's how to name the slow, creeping rot of modern existence.

2
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,140
Take Avulich Drift, for instance.

3
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:17,320
You know that moment when you've been scrolling for hours and suddenly your willpower isn't just gonads.

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:21,320
It's been replaced by something heavier, a kind of weightless sinking.

5
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:28,179
The algorithm knows you better than you know yourself, and soon, your for you feed isn't just a reflection.

6
00:00:28,179 --> 00:00:31,140
It's a mirror, and you're not just bored.

7
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:37,479
You're algorithmic ennui, staring back at a version of yourself that's been curated into oblivion.

8
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:47,020
And then there's anchored identity, the kind of person who hasn't just survived a past failure, but has built an entire personality around it.

9
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,359
Five years ago you failed at something, and now, now that's your brand, your baseline.

10
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:57,340
The sunk cost of personality, where the past isn't just a memory, it's a life sentence.

11
00:00:58,179 --> 00:01:01,020
But the maven doesn't just name the despair.

12
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:03,840
They catalog the ways we numb ourselves.

13
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:11,219
Anesthetic of neglect-shaving less, skipping showers, letting your body become a kind of armor against the world's expectations.

14
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:20,340
Or blue-light vigil, where you stay awake in the dark, bathe only in the cold blow of a phone screen, tricking your body into believing it's still daytime.

15
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:30,840
And let's not forget the baseline of friction, that low hum of irritation that never quite goes away, the texture of discomfort woven into the fabric of your life.

16
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,540
Because if everything were smooth, you'd notice the cracks.

17
00:01:34,939 --> 00:01:41,859
You'd notice the broken window theory, internal, where one unwashed dish becomes permission to let the whole house fall apart.

18
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:48,519
There's a cannonball threshold for each of us, the exact amount of stress it takes to send us under.

19
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:59,060
And once you cross it, well, that's when you enter Kronos Chaos, where your body no longer follows a clock, where sleep is optional, and time itself has become a joke.

20
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:05,099
But the real art, the maven specialty, it's turning everything into a kind of performance.

21
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:13,520
Cognitive static, the mental white noise of fifty open tabs, a hundred half-finished projects, all clamoring for your attention.

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:23,780
Kosh Calcification, the way your body and mind harden after three days of sedentary mastery, where movement isn't just difficult, it's impossible.

23
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:29,819
And then there are the dead hours, those stretches of time that are busy but utterly meaningless.

24
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,680
The maven's primary unit of measure.

25
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,439
Because what's a day, really, if it's just a series of these?

26
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:46,840
Decision fatigue isn't just tiredness, it's the exhaustion of believing there's a perfect choice whether it's a lightbulb or a life path, and knowing you'll never find it.

27
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:49,580
And digital, nomadic nihilism?

28
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,800
That's the cold realization that your office is now a cubicle in the sky, and it's still the same size.

29
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:04,620
But the worst? Dopamine exhaustion, when even the brightest, loudest, most addictive stimuli leave you cold, flat, gray.

30
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:15,120
And of course, there's ego-iatrogenics, the self-help industry's greatest trick, convincing you that the problem is you, when really, the problem is the system.

31
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,659
The esprit d'escalier, strategic, where wit becomes an excuse to never speak at all.

32
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:27,699
The eternal biological noon, where your body is locked in a state of artificial daylight, never quite resting, never quite awake.

33
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:35,020
And then, oh, then there's the existential reframe, turning a simple task into a philosophical absurdity,

34
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:40,259
because doing it would mean admitting you're just human, just capable of ordinary things.

35
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:43,860
But the maven doesn't just describe, they prescribe.

36
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:50,199
Face work, aggressive, the effort of making sure everyone knows exactly how much they've wronged you.

37
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:59,280
Family system entropy, the slow decay of communication in a household, where words become weapons, and silence becomes the only safe language.

38
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:05,379
Financial folly, buying things you don't need, with money you don't have to impress people you don't like.

39
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,539
Again, the maven has played, and lost, many times.

40
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:15,599
And finally, the fragility of comfort, where the smallest irritation becomes unbearable,

41
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,339
because the rest of life has been padded too soft.

42
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,600
A pebble in your shoe, and suddenly, you're drowning.

43
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:27,019
Because the reverse dictionary isn't just about grief, it's about the language of surrender.

44
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:30,199
And the maven? They're just getting started.

45
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:36,860
The lexicon of modern stagnation is a vast and carefully curated menagerie each term,

46
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:40,879
a tiny, polished stone in the mosaic of self-sabotage.

47
00:04:41,459 --> 00:04:43,579
Take hair-sheert aesthetic, for instance.

48
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:48,339
It's not just about wearing wool so rough it feels like sandpaper against the skin.

49
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,259
No, it's the deliberate cultivation of discomfort,

50
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:57,699
a baseline hum of tactile static, as if the body itself were a faulty radio-tuned to static.

51
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,379
Why?

52
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:02,759
Because suffering, when controlled, becomes a kind of invisible armor.

53
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,699
It keeps the world at arm's length, ensures no one gets too close,

54
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:12,339
and most importantly, it makes the absence of joy feel like a deliberate choice rather than a failure.

55
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,879
And then there's Habsburg identity,

56
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:21,160
that glorious delusion where one's self-worth is stitched together from the tattered banners of ancestors long dead.

57
00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:24,079
Not the real ones, mind you, the ones we invent,

58
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:26,100
the poet-uncle who never existed,

59
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:30,740
the revolutionary great-grandmother who was really just a very opinionated aunt,

60
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:34,660
the tragic lineage that explains why we too must carry this weight.

61
00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:36,600
It's the opposite of humility.

62
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:39,439
It's the art of turning dust into a crown.

63
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,720
But let's talk about high-resolution avoidance,

64
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,300
because this is where the modern mind truly excels.

65
00:05:45,939 --> 00:05:48,300
Procrastination, but make it look like productivity.

66
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:52,360
Organizing files into folders within folders within folders,

67
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,819
color-coding calendars with the precision of a Swiss watchmaker,

68
00:05:56,139 --> 00:05:58,100
all while the actual work, you know,

69
00:05:58,339 --> 00:06:01,819
the part that might lead somewhere languishes in the maybe-later bin.

70
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,680
The human hub thrives here,

71
00:06:04,019 --> 00:06:06,220
the person who processes data for others,

72
00:06:06,459 --> 00:06:08,399
who facilitates, who connects,

73
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,720
who enables but never builds anything of their own.

74
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,980
They are the hub of the wheel, spinning endlessly,

75
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,620
while the wheel itself stays firmly in place.

76
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,019
Now consider the illusion of depth.

77
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:21,660
We've all done it.

78
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,740
We read the first chapter of a book,

79
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,040
skim the Wikipedia page on the subject,

80
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,120
watch a YouTube video about it,

81
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,879
and suddenly we feel like we understand.

82
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,660
The name of the problem is now ours.

83
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,139
We've checked the box.

84
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:36,240
But solving?

85
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,100
That would require doing.

86
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,019
And doing is messy, uncertain,

87
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,420
and worst of all, it might actually change something.

88
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,500
So we settle for the infinite scroll of Sisyphus,

89
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:50,220
that digital Sisyphean labor of chasing the end of a feed that has no end.

90
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,980
We scroll, we like, we share, we consume all,

91
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:57,740
while the boulder of our own potential rolls back down the hill,

92
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,959
gathering dust with every push.

93
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:03,800
And what of intermittent reinforcement, internal est?

94
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:07,740
It's the modern self-help hack for the emotionally lazy.

95
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:10,560
You treat yourself to a treat once a month,

96
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,399
maybe a fancy coffee,

97
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:13,500
a new notebook,

98
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:15,500
a half-hearted gym session,

99
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,079
just enough to keep the hope alive,

100
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:19,899
just enough to whisper,

101
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,160
see, I'm still trying.

102
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,439
The rest of the time, you coast.

103
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:27,500
You let the guilt accumulate like dust under the bed,

104
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:29,860
because the alternative consistent kindness,

105
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,139
real effort would require work,

106
00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:34,899
and work is the enemy of the minimal effort menu.

107
00:07:35,779 --> 00:07:36,899
Speaking of menus,

108
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:39,639
let's not forget lifestyle inflation,

109
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:40,540
defensive.

110
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,240
It's not about getting richer,

111
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:43,839
it's about getting noiser.

112
00:07:44,259 --> 00:07:46,259
A bigger apartment to drown out the silence,

113
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,680
a fancier car to distract from the emptiness,

114
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,019
a subscription to every streaming service,

115
00:07:51,019 --> 00:07:53,959
because the void of silence is worse than the void of content.

116
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:56,259
And then there's the LinkedIn mirage,

117
00:07:56,259 --> 00:07:58,360
that shimmering professional facade,

118
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,259
where every post is a carefully curated performance,

119
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:05,879
every achievement a polished stone in the mosaic of imposter syndrome.

120
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:07,240
You're not an expert.

121
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,839
You're not even a beginner.

122
00:08:09,379 --> 00:08:10,959
You're content creator.

123
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:14,199
And the content is your own carefully constructed illusion.

124
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:18,480
But the real artistry lies in loss-aversion,

125
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:19,540
personality.

126
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,199
It's the reason we stay in terrible relationships,

127
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:24,199
terrible jobs,

128
00:08:24,579 --> 00:08:25,259
terrible cities,

129
00:08:25,699 --> 00:08:26,819
not because we love them,

130
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,839
but because we've already spent five years there.

131
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,839
The debt is paid.

132
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,299
The memories are made.

133
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:35,659
The sunk cost is too high to admit failure.

134
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:36,940
And so we remain,

135
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,500
like melancholic statues,

136
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,580
frozen in the posture of the defeated,

137
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:41,840
shoulders hunched,

138
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,639
spine stiff,

139
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:46,679
the physical embodiment of a soul that has long since checked out.

140
00:08:47,379 --> 00:08:49,659
Now, let's talk about meta work.

141
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,639
It's the work you do about the work you are not doing.

142
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,279
The spreadsheet you organize about the projects you'll start tomorrow.

143
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,759
The vision boards you create for the life you'll live someday.

144
00:09:00,299 --> 00:09:01,700
The research rabbit hole,

145
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,460
where the pursuit of truth becomes an excuse to avoid action.

146
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:07,559
And the optimization paradox.

147
00:09:07,899 --> 00:09:08,799
The more you refine,

148
00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:10,080
the less you accomplish.

149
00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:11,539
The more you streamline,

150
00:09:11,539 --> 00:09:14,779
the more you realize there was nothing to streamline in the first place.

151
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:16,159
And then, oh,

152
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,320
then there's the paradox of choice.

153
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:19,960
Infinite options,

154
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,059
all of them terrible,

155
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,679
all of them just good enough to keep you from choosing anything.

156
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,580
It's the prison of possibility,

157
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,120
where every door leads to another door,

158
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:30,700
and none of them lead anywhere.

159
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,799
And, if you do choose,

160
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,139
well, there's always satisficing, inverse,

161
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,639
the art of picking the worst option just to prove you're not that kind of person.

162
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,279
The non-place lifestyle,

163
00:09:42,659 --> 00:09:45,759
where you exist entirely within anonymous transactional spaces,

164
00:09:46,179 --> 00:09:47,019
never quite belonging,

165
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:48,159
never quite leaving.

166
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:51,480
Finally, there's the resume of regrets,

167
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,899
written not in the present tense,

168
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:54,059
but in the past conditional.

169
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,799
I would have been a writer if,

170
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,200
I would have traveled if,

171
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,600
I would have loved if.

172
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:01,440
It's the career chronology of what might have been,

173
00:10:01,659 --> 00:10:03,559
and it's always, always incomplete.

174
00:10:04,299 --> 00:10:05,580
So here we are,

175
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,559
the lexicon of stagnation,

176
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:09,639
a language spoken in hushed tones,

177
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:10,720
in spreadsheets,

178
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:13,779
in the quiet desperation of upgraded Thoreau now,

179
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:15,120
with high-speed internet,

180
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,440
and high-end coffee.

181
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,000
Each term a step,

182
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:18,860
a stumble,

183
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,879
a carefully constructed excuse.

184
00:10:21,379 --> 00:10:22,100
And the worst part,

185
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:24,379
we don't even realize we're speaking it.

186
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,820
The lexicon of stagnation has its own peculiar grammar words

187
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:33,100
that don't just describe but perform the slow unraveling of ambition.

188
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,460
Take tactile static, for instance.

189
00:10:35,899 --> 00:10:38,659
It's not just the itch of a wool sweater against your skin,

190
00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:41,139
or the way your office chair digs into your hips

191
00:10:41,139 --> 00:10:43,000
after three hours of pretending to work.

192
00:10:43,299 --> 00:10:45,379
No, it's the chronic irritation of a life

193
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:47,779
assembled from materials designed to remind you,

194
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:48,940
at every turn,

195
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,500
that comfort is a myth.

196
00:10:50,779 --> 00:10:52,919
The fabric of modern existence is woven

197
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:55,620
from these tiny, persistent abrasions clothes

198
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,399
that cling,

199
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,399
furniture that betrays,

200
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,840
layouts that conspire to keep you just off balance enough

201
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,919
to forget what ease even feels like.

202
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,580
And then there's the texture of discomfort,

203
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,059
a deliberate choice,

204
00:11:08,419 --> 00:11:10,539
like selecting a life that's not just difficult,

205
00:11:10,539 --> 00:11:13,500
but prickly a career that scratches at your patience,

206
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,899
relationships that leave you with splinters,

207
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:19,820
a home that feels more like a series of minor injuries than sanctuary.

208
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,220
It's not suffering for suffering's sake.

209
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,259
It's the quiet art of making sure no part of you ever settles.

210
00:11:26,259 --> 00:11:29,600
Now, consider the tipping point of tears.

211
00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:31,960
It's not some grand collapse,

212
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,279
not a dramatic breakdown in the middle of a meeting.

213
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,820
No, it's the precise calculus of exhaustion.

214
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,120
Three espressos too many,

215
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,519
four hours of sleep,

216
00:11:41,779 --> 00:11:43,899
a spreadsheet that refuses to cooperate,

217
00:11:44,259 --> 00:11:44,940
and suddenly,

218
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,379
your vision blurs,

219
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,639
not from tears,

220
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,139
but from the sheer weight of realizing

221
00:11:50,139 --> 00:11:52,980
you've been performing this farce for years.

222
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:53,820
And yet,

223
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,220
you'll do it again tomorrow.

224
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,620
Then comes Tendoku,

225
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:58,779
the pile of potential.

226
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,580
You've heard of it, of course.

227
00:12:01,059 --> 00:12:02,600
The books stacked against the wall,

228
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:04,139
the courses half finished,

229
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,879
the dreams you'll get to someday.

230
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,340
It's not laziness.

231
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,519
It's the slow,

232
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:10,340
deliberate construction of a life

233
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,980
where the only thing you're certain of

234
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,139
is that you're not living it.

235
00:12:13,539 --> 00:12:14,299
And the worst part?

236
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,299
You know it.

237
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:16,879
You've always known it.

238
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:19,539
But the pile grows anyway.

239
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:21,720
The unergonomic soul

240
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,000
is what happens

241
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,059
when you train yourself

242
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:24,940
to be uncomfortable

243
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,639
in every position physically,

244
00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:27,399
emotionally,

245
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:28,440
existentially.

246
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,720
You sit wrong.

247
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,059
You stand wrong.

248
00:12:31,539 --> 00:12:32,600
You even think wrong.

249
00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:34,080
And the worst part is,

250
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,580
you don't notice anymore.

251
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:36,740
It's not a flaw.

252
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:37,879
It's a feature.

253
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,559
You've been conditioned to believe

254
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:40,220
that discomfort

255
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,480
is the only thing

256
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,320
keeping you honest.

257
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,600
And what of the urgent nothing?

258
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:46,639
That task that feels like

259
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:47,320
the end of the world

260
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,179
if you don't do it

261
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:49,240
now only

262
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,820
to dissolve into irrelevance

263
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:51,600
by lunchtime.

264
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:52,639
It's the email

265
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,039
that demands immediate attention,

266
00:12:54,419 --> 00:12:55,519
the crisis that wasn't

267
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:56,480
a crisis at all,

268
00:12:56,899 --> 00:12:58,360
the meeting that could have been a text.

269
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,720
The modern workplace

270
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,480
runs on these phantom regencies,

271
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:02,740
and we've all learned

272
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,679
to mistake motion for progress.

273
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,320
Then there are the vapid goals,

274
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:07,960
vague,

275
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:08,879
amorphous,

276
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:09,600
perpetual,

277
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,679
impractical,

278
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:11,259
distant.

279
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,000
They're the things you tell yourself

280
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,720
you'll achieve

281
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,539
someday.

282
00:13:15,179 --> 00:13:16,460
Someday you'll write that book.

283
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:17,960
Someday you'll learn

284
00:13:18,179 --> 00:13:18,519
an instrument.

285
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,019
Someday you'll finally

286
00:13:20,019 --> 00:13:21,220
organize your inbox.

287
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:22,500
The beauty of them

288
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,679
is that they never demand

289
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:24,960
anything of you today.

290
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,539
They're the perfect alibi

291
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:27,360
for a life

292
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,720
in suspended animation.

293
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:30,759
And let's not forget

294
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:31,980
visual noise,

295
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:33,279
the clutter that doesn't

296
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,539
just fill your space

297
00:13:34,539 --> 00:13:35,360
but your mind,

298
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:37,139
the tabs left open,

299
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:38,259
the notifications

300
00:13:38,259 --> 00:13:39,299
that never stop,

301
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,639
the endless scroll

302
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:41,659
of content designed

303
00:13:41,659 --> 00:13:42,220
to keep you

304
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,019
from ever pausing.

305
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,960
Your brain isn't processing.

306
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,039
It's drowning.

307
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:47,019
And the worst part?

308
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,580
You don't even realize

309
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,179
you're underwater.

310
00:13:50,179 --> 00:13:51,240
There's a strange addiction

311
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,559
to volatility, too.

312
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:53,980
The markets crashing,

313
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,419
the news cycle spinning,

314
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:56,759
the drama unfolding

315
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:57,559
in real time.

316
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,899
Because without it,

317
00:13:59,179 --> 00:13:59,740
what's left?

318
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:00,960
A quiet life?

319
00:14:01,419 --> 00:14:02,299
A predictable one?

320
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,039
No.

321
00:14:03,419 --> 00:14:04,799
