1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:06,580
And so we reach the end of our journey through the architecture of despair.

2
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:11,640
You have now completed Miserable, How to Fail at Life, a comprehensive guide to optimizing

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,759
your existence for maximum suffering.

4
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:19,199
If you've made it this far, congratulations, you are now fully equipped to sabotage your

5
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,339
own happiness with precision and consistency.

6
00:00:22,339 --> 00:00:27,539
Remember, true mastery is not the absence of failure, but the deliberate curation of

7
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:28,539
it.

8
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:32,359
A final note from The Reverse Maven.

9
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:35,359
This book is, of course, satire.

10
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:39,920
If any of these techniques actually resonated with you, if you found yourself nodding along

11
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,700
and thinking, yes, this is exactly what I do, then perhaps it's time to put down the audiobook

12
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:52,219
and pick up the phone, call a friend, talk to a therapist, go outside and look at a tree.

13
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:57,200
The self-help industrial complex is absurd, but genuine human connection, professional

14
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,020
mental health support and basic self-care are not.

15
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:09,840
This has been Miserable, How to Fail at Life, written and narrated by The Reverse Maven.

Thank you for listening.

20
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,480
Now go forth, and be slightly less miserable.

21
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,480
End of audiobook.

22
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,299
End of audiobook.
