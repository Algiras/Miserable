Welcome to another installment in our ongoing series: *Miserable: How to Fail at Life*. Today's topic is a personal favorite—a masterclass in self-sabotage that's both accessible and devastatingly effective.

# Nutritional Nihilism

**Prep time: 0 minutes | Digest time: Eternity**

They say "you are what you eat." If you want to be a miserable, lethargic heap of self-loathing, you must eat like one.

### The Ingredients of Apathy
- 1 Large bag of "Extreme" flavored corn chips
- 4 Liters of diet soda (for the chemical aftertaste)
- 1 Family-sized frozen pizza (consumed alone)
- A complete absence of vegetables

### Instructions
1. **The Breakfast of Guilt**: Start your day with something that has a shelf life longer than your current relationship. Avoid protein; you want a sugar spike that crashes by 10:30 AM.
2. **Grazing in the Dark**: Do not sit at a table. Eat while standing over the sink or, ideally, while sitting in a dark room illuminated only by a laptop screen. This removes the "ceremony" of eating and leaves only the mechanical intake of calories.
3. **The Salt Saturation**: Every meal should be salty enough to make your fingers swell. The physical discomfort of minor bloating is an excellent baseline for irritability.
4. **The Sugar Hook**: When the midday slump hits, do not reach for water. Fuel the crash with a high-fructose corn syrup delivery system. 

### Why this works
By consistently feeding yourself food that makes you feel physically ill, you eliminate the possibility of a "good mood." It’s hard to feel optimistic when your gut is actively protesting your life choices. 

*Chef's Tip: If you feel a "craving" for an apple, quickly watch a 15-second ad for a double-bacon cheeseburger to recalibrate your desires.*
