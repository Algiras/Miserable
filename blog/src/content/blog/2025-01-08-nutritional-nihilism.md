**How to Become a Human Who Hates Their Own Existence (With Recipes)**

Let’s be honest—you’re already halfway there. Maybe you’ve stared into the abyss of your fridge at 2 AM, only to find it staring back with judgmental, unwashed lettuce. Or perhaps you’ve watched a YouTuber eat a bowl of cereal while wearing a superhero cape and thought, *"I could never be that confident."* Well, good news: you don’t have to. Because if you follow this *nutritionally sound* (read: *psychologically devastating*) guide, you’ll soon be a master of self-sabotage, turning every meal into a slow-motion act of self-flagellation. After all, if you can’t love yourself, why bother with love *anything*?

### **The Ultimate Meal Plan for Existential Dread**
**Yields:** One person who will eventually question their life choices while staring at a wall.

#### **Ingredients:**
- **1 Large bag of "Extreme" flavored corn chips** (because regular chips are for people who still believe in joy)
- **4 liters of diet soda** (the only thing dieting has left you with—regret)
- **1 family-sized frozen pizza** (consumed alone, because even the cheese is judging you)
- **A complete absence of vegetables** (unless you enjoy the irony of your body betraying you)
- **Optional:** A side of existential dread (included free with every meal)

#### **Instructions:**

1. **The Breakfast of Guilt**
   Start your day with something that has a shelf life longer than your current relationship. Avoid protein; you want a sugar spike that crashes by 10:30 AM. *"But what about fiber?"* you ask. Fiber is for people who still believe in digestion. Today, you’re building a life where your stomach is just a temporary home for regret.

2. **Grazing in the Dark**
   Do not sit at a table. Eat while standing over the sink or, ideally, while sitting in a dark room illuminated only by a laptop screen. This removes the "ceremony" of eating and leaves only the mechanical intake of calories. *"But what about socializing?"* you might wonder. Socializing is for people who still believe in human connection. You’re building a life where even your meals are lonely.

3. **The Salt Saturation**
   Every meal should be salty enough to make your fingers swell. The physical discomfort of minor bloating is an excellent baseline for irritability. *"But what about flavor?"* Flavor is for people who still believe in taste. You’re building a life where your taste buds are just another thing to resent.

4. **The Sugar Hook**
   When the midday slump hits, do not reach for water. Fuel the crash with a high-fructose corn syrup delivery system. *"But what about hydration?"* Hydration is for people who still believe in survival. You’re building a life where your body is just a vessel for self-loathing.

**Note from the Chef:**
If you feel a "craving" for an apple, quickly watch a 15-second ad for a double-bacon cheeseburger to recalibrate your desires. *"But what about balance?"* Balance is for people who still believe in moderation. You’re building a life where balance is just another word for surrender.

So there you have it—the perfect recipe for turning your body into a protest against your own existence. Congratulations! You’ve just invented a new form of self-harm that’s so subtle, even you won’t notice it until you’re staring into the abyss of your fridge at 2 AM, wondering why you’re still alive. *"But what about health?"* Health is for people who still believe in tomorrow. You’re building a life where today is enough.
