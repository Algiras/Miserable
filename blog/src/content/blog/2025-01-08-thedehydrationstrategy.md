**Mood**: Slightly unhinged  
**Location**: Scattered across the floor of my own expectations  
**Mental State**: Loading... 99% complete (estimated time: infinity)

# The Incident

So, today was a thing. I found a gray hair in my eyebrow and spent four hours researching the cost of cryogenics. It turns out freezing your head is expensive, and I can't even afford a decent pillow.

I stood there for a long time, just taking it in. The realization that I am an adult who is allegedly in charge of things is the most recurring nightmare I have. 

# The Spiral

The theme of the week is **The Dehydration Strategy**. 

Modern life is just a series of updates that make everything slightly worse. I'm waiting for a firmware patch for my personality, but it's currently 'stuck at 1%'.

I'm convinced that 'adulthood' is just a group project where no one did the reading and we're all pretending we know what's on the slide.

# The Aftermath

I'm going to lie on the floor until the gravity of my decisions becomes a literal force that prevents me from ever getting up again. It's quite cozy.

I'm going to sleep for ten hours and wake up even more tired. It's a physiological miracle that doctors can't explain but millennials experience daily.

*Mood update: I've decided to be at peace with my own destruction. For the next hour, at least.*
