# The Incident

So, today was a thing. I accidentally liked a three-year-old photo of my ex's new dog. The level of digital archeology required to find that post is evidence enough that I need professional help.

I stood there for a long time, just taking it in. The realization that I am an adult who is allegedly in charge of things is the most recurring nightmare I have. 

# The Spiral

The theme of the week is **Blue Light Bathing**. 

The concept of a 'career path' is increasingly hilarious. It's more like a series of stumbles across a dark room full of Lego bricks. You just hope the next step doesn't hurt.

# The Aftermath

I'm currently staring at a blinking cursor that's judging me for my lack of words. We're in a standoff, and the cursor has more patience than I do.

If you see me in public, no you didn't. I'm currently a figment of my own imagination and I'd like to keep it that way for the foreseeable future.

*Mood update: I've decided to be at peace with my own destruction. For the next hour, at least.*
