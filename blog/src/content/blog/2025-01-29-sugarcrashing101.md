# The Incident

So, today was a thing. I tried to cook a 'healthy' meal and accidentally set off the smoke alarm. The fire department arrived and judged my lack of seasoning. Apparently, salt isn't a vegetable.

I stood there for a long time, just taking it in. The realization that I am an adult who is allegedly in charge of things is the most recurring nightmare I have. 

# The Spiral

The theme of the week is **Sugar Crashing 101**. 

I tried to 'reach out' to friends, but our schedules are like two ships passing in the night, and both ships are on fire and the crews are asleep.

I tried to 'find myself' and found a person who really needs to stop buying expensive candles. The truth is often disappointing and smells like 'Midnight Jasmine'.

# The Aftermath

The void called and I let it go to voicemail. I'm not in the mood for a long conversation about nothingness right now. I have snacks.

I've reached a level of apathy that borders on enlightenment. Or maybe I just need to drink some water. Hard to tell the difference these days.

*Mood update: I've decided to be at peace with my own destruction. For the next hour, at least.*
