**Title: *How to Become a Human Neon: A Spiritual Guide to Self-Sabotage***

Ah, the sun—a glorious, free, and *unreliable* source of light that demands you actually *get up* to enjoy it. How *quaint*. Meanwhile, we’ve invented artificial light, that modern marvel that lets you stare into the abyss of your phone while your body whispers, *"Please stop, you’re killing me."* Welcome to *Artificial Light as a Spiritual Guide*, where we’ll teach you to turn your circadian rhythm into a mood board for existential dread. Think of it as the ultimate "I’m fine, just tired" lifestyle upgrade—now with 100% less sleep and 200% more existential angst.

This recipe is for the spiritually ambitious (read: *chronically exhausted*) who want to achieve *Eternal Biological Noon*—a state where your body thinks it’s 3 PM at 3 AM, your melatonin is on strike, and your only relationship with sunlight is through a screen filter. By the end, you’ll be a *Human Neon*: glowing, hollow, and utterly convinced you’re *productively* suffering. Let’s get started.

### **Artificial Light as a Spiritual Guide**
**Yields:** One perpetually exhausted, blue-light-addicted soul who mistakes "busy" for "alive."

#### **Ingredients:**
- **1 part** high-intensity LED bulb (cool white, 5000K or higher—warmth is for people who still believe in seasons)
- **1 part** smartphone or tablet (preferably with a "Night Shift" setting you *never* use)
- **1 part** blackout curtains (for when you want to pretend the sun is a myth)
- **1 part** caffeine (coffee, energy drinks, or that one energy gel you keep "for emergencies")
- **1 part** a sense of existential dread (optional, but highly recommended)
- **1 part** a desk chair (for when you realize you’ve been sitting for 12 hours straight)

#### **Instructions:**

1. **The "Blue-Screen" Vigil**
   Set up your phone or tablet in a pitch-black room. The contrast between the blinding blue light and the void will send your melatonin levels into a spiral of despair. *Pro tip:* If you’re feeling particularly ambitious, do this while lying in bed—your brain will think you’re asleep, but your body will be screaming, *"I’m not asleep, I’m just *existing* in a void!"*

2. **The "Fluorescent" Workspace**
   Replace all natural light sources with cool-white LEDs. If you have a window, cover it with blackout curtains. The goal is to create a space that feels like a hospital hallway—clinical, sterile, and *perfectly* devoid of warmth. Bonus points if your workspace resembles a futuristic prison cell.

3. **The "Blackout" Fallacy**
   Keep those blackout curtains closed *even during the day*. Your body needs to think it’s always nighttime so it never gets the hint that it should *rest*. If you *must* step outside, wear sunglasses indoors to confuse your brain further. *"Wait, is this light real? Or am I just hallucinating because I haven’t slept in 36 hours?"*

4. **The "Intermittent" Flicker**
   Introduce a little chaos. Use a bulb that flickers slightly, or leave your screen on low battery to create a "glitchy" effect. This will keep your amygdala in a state of mild panic, which is *technically* a form of stimulation—just not the kind that makes you feel *human*.

#### **Note from the Chef:**
*"The sun is for those who have a destination. The light-bulb is for those who have a screen."* —Anonymous Existentialist

**Conclusion:**

Congratulations! You’ve just mastered the art of being a *Human Neon*—a glowing, hollow shell of a person who mistakes "doomscrolling" for "deep thinking" and "all-nighters" for "productivity." You’re not lazy; you’re *evolving*. You’re not tired; you’re *curating your energy*. And when you finally collapse into bed at 4 AM, don’t worry—your body will just think you’re *asleep* (even though you’re not). After all, what’s a little sleep deprivation when you can have *spiritual enlightenment*? Now go forth and glow. Just don’t expect anyone to notice you in the dark.
