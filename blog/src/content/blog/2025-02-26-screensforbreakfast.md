# The Incident

So, today was a thing. I spent forty-five minutes debating whether a stain on a t-shirt counts as a 'pattern'. I eventually decided it's 'found art' and wore it to a Zoom meeting.

I stood there for a long time, just taking it in. The realization that I am an adult who is allegedly in charge of things is the most recurring nightmare I have. 

# The Spiral

The theme of the week is **Screens for Breakfast**. 

The abyss doesn't just stare back; it occasionally sends you a 'personalized recommendation' based on your browsing history. It's very intimate.

I tried to 'manifest' a better life and all I got was a targeted ad for a weighted blanket. Apparently, the universe thinks I just need to be pinned down.

# The Aftermath

I tried to 'unplug' and realized my entire identity is stored on a server in Virginia. Without Wi-Fi, I'm just a person who doesn't know what time it is.

It's enough for one-sixteenth of a therapy session. Maybe I'll just ask the barista for advice. They're usually just as tired as I am.

*Mood update: I've decided to be at peace with my own destruction. For the next hour, at least.*
