# The Incident

So, today was a thing. I bought a self-help book about 'Living in the Now' and it's currently being used as a coaster for a cold cup of coffee. The irony is the only thing keeping me warm.

I stood there for a long time, just taking it in. The realization that I am an adult who is allegedly in charge of things is the most recurring nightmare I have. 

# The Spiral

The theme of the week is **Avoiding the Sun**. 

They told us to 'follow our passions' but neglected to mention that passion doesn't pay for health insurance. Now I'm just passionate about lying down in a dark room.

The concept of a 'career path' is increasingly hilarious. It's more like a series of stumbles across a dark room full of Lego bricks. You just hope the next step doesn't hurt more.

# The Aftermath

The sun is coming up, which is a bit rude if you ask me. I didn't give it permission to end the safety of the night.

Everything feels like it's made of cardboard and hope, and it's raining. But hey, at least I found a five-dollar bill in my coat pocket. It's enough for half an oat milk latte.

*Mood update: I've decided to be at peace with my own destruction. For the next hour, at least.*
