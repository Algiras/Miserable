# The Incident

So, today was a thing. I found a gray hair in my eyebrow and spent four hours researching the cost of cryogenics. It turns out freezing your head is expensive, and I can't even afford a decent pillow.

I stood there for a long time, just taking it in. The realization that I am an adult who is allegedly in charge of things is the most recurring nightmare I have. 

# The Spiral

The theme of the week is **The 3am Coffee**. 

The concept of a 'career path' is increasingly hilarious. It's more like a series of stumbles across a dark room full of Lego bricks. You just hope the next step doesn't hurt more.

I remember when I had hobbies. Now my hobby is 'scrolling until my thumb hurts'. I'm an athlete of the attention economy, and I'm losing every game.

# The Aftermath

If you see me in public, no you didn't. I'm currently a figment of my own imagination and I'd like to keep it that way.

It's enough for one-sixteenth of a therapy session. Maybe I'll just ask the barista for advice. They're usually just as tired as I am.

*Mood update: I've decided to be at peace with my own destruction. For the next hour, at least.*
