# The Incident

So, today was a thing. I stood in the 'International' aisle of the supermarket for twenty minutes just to feel like I was traveling. I left with a can of water chestnuts I don't know how to open.

I stood there for a long time, just taking it in. The realization that I am an adult who is allegedly in charge of things is the most recurring nightmare I have. 

# The Spiral

The theme of the week is **Regretting 2014**. 

I tried to 'manifest' a better life and all I got was a targeted ad for a weighted blanket. Apparently, the universe thinks I just need to be pinned down.

We live in a world where your refrigerator can tell you if you're out of milk, but it can't tell you why your heart feels like a deflated balloon. Technology has solved everything except the meaning of it all.

# The Aftermath

It's enough for one-sixteenth of a therapy session. Maybe I'll just ask the barista for advice. They're usually just as tired as I am.

If you see me in public, no you didn't. I'm currently a figment of my own imagination and I'd like to keep it that way.

*Mood update: I've decided to be at peace with my own destruction. For the next hour, at least.*
