# The Sunk Cost of Personality

In 19th-century Italy, there existed a profession known as the *Prefiche*—professional mourners. These women were hired to weep, wail, and tear their clothes at funerals. Their entire economic and social identity was built on grief. Over decades, many of these women found that they could no longer experience genuine joy; they had become "anchored" to their performance of sorrow. They were the original masters of the **Sunk Cost of Personality**.

In behavioral economics, the **Sunk Cost Fallacy** is the tendency to continue an endeavor once an investment in money, effort, or time has been made, even if the current costs outweigh the future benefits. 

In the pursuit of misery, we apply this to the "Self." If you have spent ten years being the "cynical one," the "lonely one," or the "unlucky one," you have invested too much in that identity to let it go. To change would be to admit that the last decade was a waste. And so, you continue to "invest" in your own misery.

## The Identity Dividend

Most people want to "find themselves." For the Maven, this is a dangerous pursuit. If you find yourself and you happen to be happy, you lose your "Sunk Cost." You lose the "Dividend" of being consistent. There is a strange, dark comfort in being the person everyone expects you to be—even if that person is miserable.

## Instructions for Personality Rigidity

1.  **The Narrative Lock-In**: Tell the same "Origin Story" of your failure to everyone you meet. Remind them of the grade you failed in 1998 or the breakup in 2012. By repeating the story, you reinforce the "Sunk Cost" of the event, ensuring it remains a central pillar of your personality.
2.  **The "Consistency" Trap**: If you feel an unexpected urge to try something new—say, a dance class or a new hobby—suppress it immediately. Ask yourself, "What would my friends think? That's not me." By prioritizing consistency over growth, you protect your "Porcelain Identity" (see *Part 2*).
3.  **The Defensive Archive**: Keep physical or digital artifacts of your past failures. Unsent angry letters, photos of your "glory days," or a list of people who have wronged you. These are your "Capital Investments" in misery; keep them close so you never forget why you are the way you are.
4.  **The "Too Late" Fallacy**: Whenever an opportunity for change arises, use the "Too Late" anchor. "I'm forty now, it's too late to change my career." "I've been alone so long, I wouldn't know how to be with someone." This allows you to stay in your "Sunk Cost" while feeling like a realist.

## The Result: The Relic of the Self

The goal of the Sunk Cost of Personality is to turn you into a **Relic of the Self**. You are a museum devoted to your own past. You have achieved the ultimate mindset misery: the inability to change because you are too loyal to the person you used to be. You are the professional mourner at your own funeral, and you're doing a magnificent job.

## Analytic Note: Regretting 2014
In the *Resident's Log (April 22)*, the subject illustrates "Regretting 2014." By fixating on a single year of perceived failure, they ensure that every subsequent year is merely a "Post-Script" to that failure. They are a prisoner of their own timeline.
