**How to Become the Professional Mourner of Your Own Life (A Recipe for Unbreakable Self-Sabotage)**

Let’s be honest—you’ve already spent years cultivating your "brand." Maybe it’s the "perpetually jaded" one, the "chronically unlucky" one, or the "emotionally unavailable" one. Congratulations! You’ve mastered the art of turning your life into a cautionary tale. But what if I told you there’s a *recipe* for doubling down on this brilliance? A foolproof method to ensure you never accidentally stumble into happiness? Welcome to the **Sunk Cost of Personality**, where your identity isn’t just a personality—it’s an investment portfolio in misery. And like any good financial disaster, it’s *guaranteed* to yield returns.

### **The Professional Mourner’s Identity (Yields: A Lifetime of "I Told You So")**

#### **Ingredients:**
- **10+ years of self-pity** (use expired batches if available)
- **Unlimited "origin stories"** (the 2012 breakup, the failed exam, the one friend who "really got you")
- **A "consistency" mantra** ("That’s not me!"—repeat ad nauseam)
- **Digital/physical archives of failure** (old texts, unsent emails, a "Why I’m Single" scrapbook)
- **The "Too Late" excuse** (age, timing, fate—your call)
- **A willing audience** (friends, family, or at least one cat who judges you silently)

#### **Instructions:**

1. **The Narrative Lock-In**
   Craft your "Origin Story" like it’s a Netflix limited series—dramatic, unrelenting, and *always* your fault. Every conversation must include the 1998 grade you failed or the 2012 breakup that "changed you forever." The more you tell it, the more it becomes *true*. (Pro tip: If someone asks, *"How are you?"* reply, *"Still recovering from 2014."*)

2. **The "Consistency" Trap**
   Whenever you feel the *audacity* to try something new—say, a hobby, a relationship, or a new haircut—immediately panic. *"What would my friends think?"* they’ll ask. *"That’s not me!"* you’ll reply, because nothing says "I’m committed to my misery" like refusing to grow.

3. **The Defensive Archive**
   Keep a *curated* collection of your past failures. Unsent angry emails, photos of your "glory days" (read: your 20s), or a spreadsheet titled *"Why I’ll Never Be Happy."* These are your *capital investments*—proof that you’re *right* to stay stuck. (Bonus: If anyone questions your choices, pull out the archive and say, *"This is why I’m this way."*)

4. **The "Too Late" Fallacy**
   Every time an opportunity for change arises, deploy the *"Too Late"* anchor. *"I’m 40 now—it’s too late to change careers."* *"I’ve been alone so long, I wouldn’t know how to be with someone."* This isn’t realism; it’s *art*. You’re not stuck—you’re *curating* your legacy.

**Note from the Chef:**
*"Consistency is key."* Unlike a soufflé, your personality doesn’t need to rise—it needs to *stay* exactly as it is. The goal isn’t growth; it’s *preservation*. You’re not a person; you’re a *relic*. And like a fine wine, the longer you sit in your own bitterness, the more valuable you become—at least to yourself.

**Conclusion:**
So there you have it—the blueprint for turning your life into a museum exhibit. You’re not just "stuck"; you’re *curating*. And let’s be real: if you’re reading this, you’re already halfway there. The only question left is—*how soon can you start charging admission?* After all, as the great philosophers of self-sabotage once said: *"If it’s not broken, keep breaking it—just in case."*
