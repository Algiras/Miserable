**Mood**: Slightly unhinged  
**Location**: Scattered across the floor of my own expectations  
**Mental State**: Loading... 99% complete (estimated time: infinity)

# The Incident

So, today was a thing. I went to a networking event and accidentally told a CEO that my passion was 'uninterrupted silence'. He wrote it down. I think I'm accidentally a thought leader.

I stood there for a long time, just taking it in. The realization that I am an adult who is allegedly in charge of things is the most recurring nightmare I have. 

# The Spiral

The theme of the week is **Future-Tripping**. 

They told us to 'follow our passions' but neglected to mention that passion doesn't pay for health insurance. Now I'm just passionate about lying down in a dark room.

I remember when I had hobbies. Now my hobby is 'scrolling until my thumb hurts'. I'm an athlete of the attention economy, and I'm losing every single game.

# The Aftermath

I'm going to sleep for ten hours and wake up even more tired. It's a physiological miracle that doctors can't explain but millennials experience daily.

I'm going to watch a documentary about deep-sea creatures because at least they have a good excuse for being under a lot of pressure.

*Mood update: I've decided to be at peace with my own destruction. For the next hour, at least.*
