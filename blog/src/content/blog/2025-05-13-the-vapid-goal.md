Welcome to another installment in our ongoing series: *Miserable: How to Fail at Life*. Today's topic is a personal favorite—a masterclass in self-sabotage that's both accessible and devastatingly effective.

# VAPID Goals

In the late 1960s, the British and French governments embarked on a technological miracle: the Concorde. It was the world’s first supersonic passenger jet, capable of crossing the Atlantic in under four hours. It was a masterpiece of engineering, a status symbol, and a source of immense national pride. 

But it was also a financial catastrophe. The Concorde cost so much to develop and operate that it could never turn a profit. Yet, the governments kept pouring money into it. They had already invested too much to stop. This phenomenon became known in behavioral economics as the "**Concorde Fallacy**"—the tendency to continue an endeavor once an investment in money, effort, or time has been made, regardless of the outcome.

The Concorde was a magnificent goal. It was also an impossible one. And that is why it is the patron saint of **VAPID Goals**.

## The Ambition Trap

Common life advice tells you to set "SMART" goals—Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. This is a recipe for success, which makes it a dangerous ingredient for misery. Success provides closure, and closure is the enemy of the long, lingering despair we seek.

To stay truly miserable, you must adopt the **VAPID** framework.

When we set an impossible goal, we get an immediate rush of dopamine. We feel like the person who *could* achieve it. But because the goal is fundamentally VAPID, we never actually reach it. We spend our lives in the "planning stage," perpetually fueled by the excitement of a new beginning and perpetually crushed by the weight of inevitable failure [@sirois2014procrastination].

## The VAPID Framework

To ensure your goals lead to maximum dissatisfaction, they must follow these five criteria:

1.  **Vague**: Avoid specificity. Do not say "I want to run a 5k." Say "I want to be a person of vitality." If you can't define the goal, you can't tell when you've failed, which allows the anxiety of potential failure to last forever.
2.  **Amorphous**: Ensure there is no way to measure progress. If you can't see the finish line, you can never feel the satisfaction of the middle-ground. You are either "not there yet" or "failures."
3.  **Pointless**: Choose goals that solve nothing. Spend six months learning to play the accordion while your primary source of income is disappearing. The mismatch between effort and utility is a key driver of regret.
4.  **Impossible**: Aim for the legendary. Do not aim for a promotion; aim to be the CEO of a company that doesn't exist yet. The larger the gap between your reality and your goal, the deeper the "Despair Gap."
5.  **Distracting**: Use your VAPID goal as a shield to avoid the actual problems in your life. If your marriage is failing, take up extreme mountain unicycling.

## The Concorde Maneuver

The final step in a VAPID goal is to announce it publicly. Tell your friends, your family, and your social media followers. This ensures that when you inevitably abandon the goal (after spending $2,000 on unicycling gear), you add the heavy garnish of public shame to your private failure.

> "A goal you can achieve is a goal that can't haunt you. Aim for the impossible, and live in the shadow of your own ambition."
