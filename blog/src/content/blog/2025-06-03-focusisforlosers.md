# The Incident

So, today was a thing. The person at the checkout said 'Have a nice day' and I replied 'You too' even though it was 11 PM and the day was clearly over. I am currently considering a name change and moving to a different continent.

I stood there for a long time, just taking it in. The realization that I am an adult who is allegedly in charge of things is the most recurring nightmare I have. 

# The Spiral

The theme of the week is **Focus is for Losers**. 

Everything is a 'subscription' now. My gym, my music, my software. I'm waiting for the 'Happiness Pro' tier, but I suspect it's just a 7-day free trial that leads to a bill I can't pay.

Is it 'self-care' if you're just avoiding the life you built? I spent the weekend 'recharging', but the battery is leaking and the charger is frayed.

# The Aftermath

The void called and I let it go to voicemail. I'm not in the mood for a long conversation about nothingness right now.

I'm writing this under a blanket fort I built to hide from my landlord's email. It's not a permanent solution, but the acoustics are great for whispering 'why'.

*Mood update: I've decided to be at peace with my own destruction. For the next hour, at least.*
