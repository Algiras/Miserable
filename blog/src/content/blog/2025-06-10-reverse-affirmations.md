**Reverse Affirmations: A Recipe for Voluntary Mediocrity (With Optional Existential Crisis)**

Let’s be honest—self-help culture is the spiritual equivalent of a buffet where the only dish is *"I Am Enough"* served with a side of cognitive dissonance. We’ve all tried the traditional affirmations: *"I am a high performer!"* (said while scrolling through LinkedIn envy), *"I am worthy!"* (while silently calculating how many more hours you’ll need to put in to justify that promotion), or *"I am enough!"* (while Googling *"how to be less of a fraud"* at 2 AM). But what if the real rebellion isn’t in pretending you’re a superhero? What if the most subversive act of all is **deliberately reminding yourself that you’re not**? Welcome to *Reverse Affirmations*—where self-sabotage becomes an art form, and your inner critic gets a promotion to CEO of your own life.

This isn’t therapy; it’s **psychological guerrilla warfare**. It’s the spiritual equivalent of eating a whole pizza by yourself at 3 AM while whispering *"I am a failure"* into the void. It’s the practice of turning your own self-worth into a middle finger to the system. And no, we’re not suggesting you actually believe it—we’re suggesting you **stop pretending you don’t**. Because let’s face it: if you’re reading this, you’ve already lost. The question is whether you’re going to lose with grace (or at least with a smirk) or with the quiet desperation of a corporate drone who still checks their email at midnight.

### **Reverse Affirmations: Yields**
**Serves:** One very confused, slightly unhinged human (with optional side effects of existential dread and workplace disengagement).
**Prep Time:** 5 minutes (or 5 years, if you’re doing this right).
**Cook Time:** Lifetime (or until you get fired, fired, or fired).
**Difficulty:** ★★★★☆ (Requires no skill, only the willingness to embrace your own mediocrity).

---

### **Ingredients**
- **1 part** of your favorite traditional affirmation (e.g., *"I am worthy," "I am capable," "I am enough"*).
- **1 part** of your inner critic’s worst insults (e.g., *"You’re a fraud," "You’ll never amount to anything," "Your career is a joke"*).
- **½ part** of cognitive dissonance (for maximum psychological discomfort).
- **1 dash** of Byung-Chul Han’s *"burnout society"* critique (because capitalism is the real villain here).
- **Optional:** A mirror (for maximum psychological impact), a notebook (to track your slow descent into nihilism), and a side of existential dread (highly recommended).

### **Instructions**

1. **Identify Your Core Affirmation**
   Grab your current go-to affirmation—the one you repeat like a broken record while staring at your reflection or your to-do list. Examples:
   - *"I am a high performer."*
   - *"I am worthy of love."*
   - *"I am enough."*
   Write it down. Now **hate it**.

2. **Invert the Script**
   Take that affirmation and **flip it into its most unflattering, self-loathing version**. Turn *"I am worthy"* into *"I am unworthy."* Turn *"I am capable"* into *"I am incompetent."* Turn *"I am enough"* into *"I am not enough—and neither is anyone else."* The goal isn’t to believe it; it’s to **stop fighting it**. Like a bad relationship, some lies are better left unchallenged.

   *Pro Tip: If your original affirmation was *"I am a badass,"* try *"I am a joke."* If it was *"I am a leader,"* try *"I am a follower."* The more absurd, the better. Absurdity is the spice of life (and self-sabotage).*

3. **Repeat Until Internalized**
   Say your Reverse Affirmation **daily**, preferably in front of a mirror. Bonus points if you say it while doing something mundane (e.g., brushing your teeth, commuting, or staring at your phone). The key is to **let it sink in without resistance**. Think of it like a bad Tinder date—you know it’s terrible, but you keep going back because you’re too afraid to admit it’s over.

   *Optional Step: Record yourself saying it. Listen back later. Congratulate yourself on your newfound authenticity.*

4. **Observe the Ripple Effects**
   You’ll start noticing **unexpected benefits**:
   - You stop trying to impress people (because you’ve already accepted that you’re a disappointment).
   - You stop caring about validation (because you’ve already decided you’re unworthy of it).
   - You become **unmanageable** in the eyes of those who expect you to perform. HR will start sending you memes about *"work-life balance."*

   *Warning: If you start enjoying this too much, you may develop a new hobby called *"voluntary incompetence."*

5. **Refine and Iterate**
   Once the initial shock wears off, **target specific areas of your life** with hyper-specific Reverse Affirmations:
   - *"My career is a joke."*
   - *"My relationships are doomed."*
   - *"I am a fraud (and so is everyone else)."*
   The more specific, the better. The goal isn’t to be right; it’s to **stop pretending you’re not already lost**.

6. **Embrace the Chaos**
   Let the Reverse Affirmations **bleed into your life**. Start forgetting appointments. Show up late. Send emails with typos. Pretend you don’t know how to use Excel. The world will react in one of two ways: either they’ll pity you, or they’ll respect your newfound authenticity. Either way, you win.

   *Final Note: If you start feeling *too* good about this, you’ve probably gone too far. The goal isn’t to become a master of self-sabotage—it’s to become a **master of your own mediocrity**.*

### **Note from the Chef**
This recipe is **not** a step-by-step guide to happiness. It’s a **manifesto for the already broken**. It’s for the people who’ve tried affirmations and found them as effective as a sugar rush. It’s for the corporate drones who’ve internalized the message that they’re not enough—and now they’re going to **prove it to themselves**.

That said, if you find yourself **actually enjoying this**, you might want to seek professional help. Or, if you’re feeling particularly rebellious, consider **burning your affirmations in a bonfire** and watching the smoke rise like a metaphor for your life. Either way, you’re now part of the club: the **Reverse Affirmation Society**, where the only rule is that there are no rules.

### **Conclusion**
Reverse Affirmations aren’t about failure—they’re about **freedom**. They’re about **rejecting the lie that you have to be anything other than exactly what you are**. In a world that rewards productivity, performance, and perfection, embracing your own unworthiness is the ultimate middle finger. It’s the spiritual equivalent of **eating a whole pizza by yourself at 3 AM while whispering *"I am a failure"* into the void**—and then **laughing at the fact that you did it anyway**.

So go ahead. Tell yourself you’re a fraud. Tell yourself you’re unworthy. Tell yourself you don’t belong. And then **watch the world react**. Because let’s be honest: if you’re not already lost, you’re not trying hard enough.

*"The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn’t exist. Reverse Affirmations are the Devil’s middle finger to that lie."* —You, now.
