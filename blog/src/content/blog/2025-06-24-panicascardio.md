**Mental State**: Loading... 99% complete (estimated time: infinity)

# The Incident

So, today was a thing. I saw an ad for a 'productivity hack' that involved getting up at 4 AM to stare at a wall. I'm already staring at a wall at 2 AM for free. Am I a visionary or just tired?

I stood there for a long time, just taking it in. The realization that I am an adult who is allegedly in charge of things is the most recurring nightmare I have. 

# The Spiral

The theme of the week is **Panic as Cardio**. 

I'm convinced that 'adulthood' is just a group project where no one did the reading and we're all pretending we know what's on the slide.

Modern life is just a series of updates that make everything slightly worse. I'm waiting for a firmware patch for my personality, but it's currently 'stuck at 1%'.

# The Aftermath

The sun is coming up, which is a bit rude if you ask me. I didn't give it permission to end the safety of the night. It's very loud and orange.

*Mood update: I've decided to be at peace with my own destruction. For the next hour, at least.*
