**Mood**: Slightly unhinged  
**Location**: Sitting in under a blanket fort I built to hide from my landlord's email  
**Mental State**: My prefrontal cortex has officially checked out for the weekend.

# The Incident

So, today was a thing. The person at the checkout said 'Have a nice day' and I replied 'You too' even though it was 11 PM and the day was clearly over. I thought about how this perfectly encapsulates my current trajectory. Usually, people have a 'glow up', but I think I'm experiencing a 'gray out'. It's like my life is being directed by a very sad European filmmaker who forgot to write a script.

I stood there for a long time, just taking it in. The realization that I am an adult who is allegedly in charge of things is the most recurring nightmare I have. I tried to meditate, but I just ended up making a mental list of every embarrassing thing I've done since the third grade. I mean, who allowed this? 

# The Spiral

The theme of the week is **The Silent Treatment**. 

It sounds like a choice, doesn't it? Like I sat down with a planner and some gel pens and decided to lean into the chaos. But it's not. It's an accumulation of every 'I'll deal with that tomorrow' and every 'it's fine' that I've uttered over the last decade. 

The concept of a 'career path' is increasingly hilarious. It's more like a series of stumbles across a dark room full of Lego bricks. You just hope the next step doesn't hurt more than the last one.

I find myself thinking about the version of me I thought I'd be. She had matching luggage and a favorite brand of olive oil. She didn't spend forty-five minutes debating whether a stain on a t-shirt counts as a 'pattern'. We're not even the same species anymore.

# The Aftermath

I'm currently trying to decide if I should face the music or just turn the music up until I can't hear my own thoughts. Option B is currently winning by a landslide. 

Everything feels like it's made of cardboard and hope, and it's raining. But hey, at least I found a five-dollar bill in my coat pocket. It's enough for half an oat milk latte or one-sixteenth of a therapy session. Decisions, decisions.

*Mood update: I've decided to be at peace with my own destruction. For the next hour, at least.*
