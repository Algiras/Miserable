# The Incident

So, today was a thing. My Spotify Wrapped told me I was in the top 1% of listeners for 'Ambient Rainy Sounds'. Even my algorithm knows I'm just trying to drown out the sound of my own existence.

I stood there for a long time, just taking it in. The realization that I am an adult who is allegedly in charge of things is the most recurring nightmare I have. 

# The Spiral

The theme of the week is **The Silent Treatment**. 

It sounds like a choice, doesn't it? Like I sat down with a planner and some gel pens and decided to lean into the chaos. But it's not. It's an accumulation of every 'it's fine' I've ever uttered.

They told us to 'follow our passions' but neglected to mention that passion doesn't pay for health insurance. Now I'm just passionate about lying down in a dark room.

# The Aftermath

I'm writing this under a blanket fort I built to hide from my landlord's email. It's not a permanent solution, but the acoustics are great for whispering 'why'.

The void called and I let it go to voicemail. I'm not in the mood for a long conversation about nothingness right now.

*Mood update: I've decided to be at peace with my own destruction. For the next hour, at least.*
