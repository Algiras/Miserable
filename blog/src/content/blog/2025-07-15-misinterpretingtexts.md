# The Incident

So, today was a thing. I spent forty-five minutes debating whether a stain on a t-shirt counts as a 'pattern'. I eventually decided it's 'found art' and wore it to a Zoom meeting.

I stood there for a long time, just taking it in. The realization that I am an adult who is allegedly in charge of things is the most recurring nightmare I have. 

# The Spiral

The theme of the week is **Misinterpreting Texts**. 

We live in a world where your refrigerator can tell you if you're out of milk, but it can't tell you why your heart feels like a deflated balloon. Technology has solved everything except the meaning of it all.

I find myself thinking about the version of me I thought I'd be. She had matching luggage and a favorite brand of olive oil. We're not even the same species anymore.

# The Aftermath

I'm going to eat a family-sized bag of frozen peas and call it 'meal prep'. Tomorrow is a new day, which is the worst thing about it.

I'm currently trying to decide if I should face the music or just turn the music up until I can't hear my own thoughts. Option B is currently winning by a landslide.

*Mood update: I've decided to be at peace with my own destruction. For the next hour, at least.*
