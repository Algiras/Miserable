# The Resume of Regrets

In the late 19th century, the patent offices of Europe and America were flooded with the designs of "Failed Inventors"—men who had spent their lives and fortunes on machines that didn't work. When these men were interviewed, they rarely spoke of their own technical errors. Instead, they produced long, detailed "Manuscripts of Obstruction"—lists of the people, institutions, and family members who had supposedly prevented their success. They had converted their life's work into a **Resume of Regrets**.

In cognitive psychology, **Counterfactual Thinking** is the process of imagining alternative outcomes to past events—the "What Ifs." While this can be a tool for learning, the Maven uses it for **Retrospective Stagnation**.

By framing your career not as a series of choices, but as a series of "Closed Doors," you ensure that your past is a source of permanent, unfixable dissatisfaction.

## The Omission Bias as a Shield

Social psychology identifies the **Omission Bias**—the tendency to judge harmful actions (doing something) more severely than harmful inactions (not doing something). To stay miserable, you must master the art of the **Strategic Omission**. 

If you didn't apply for the promotion, you didn't "fail"; you merely "didn't act." This allows you to live in a fantasy world where you *would* have succeeded if only you had tried, while never actually having to risk the stress of trying.

## Instructions for a Career of Could-Have-Beens

1.  **The "Pivot" Archive**: Reframe every job you've left as a "Pivot" that failed because of someone else. "I left that company right before they went public because my manager didn't understand my vision." This keeps your ego "Antifragile" (see *Part 2*) while keeping your bank account empty.
2.  **The "Ghost" Network**: Keep a list of former colleagues who have become more successful than you. Use their success as a metric for your own "Bad Luck." "If I had stayed at X, I would be where Y is now." This is "Upward Social Comparison" (see *Numerical Obsession*) on a chronological scale.
3.  **The "Perfect Opportunity" Mirage**: Convince yourself that you are just waiting for the "Right Move." Use "Maximization" (see *The Paradox of Choice*) to reject any real opportunity that isn't perfect. This ensures you spend your whole life standing in the "Hallway of Potential" (see *Part 3*).
4.  **The Resume of Excuses**: When asked about your career, never talk about what you *did*. Talk about why you *couldn't* do what you wanted. "I had the idea for Uber in 2005, but I didn't have the funding." (see *The Intellectualization of Avoidance*).

## The Result: The Human Afterthought

The goal of the Resume of Regrets is to turn you into a **Human Afterthought**. You are a person whose history is written in the "Past Conditional" tense—you *would have* been great, you *should have* been rich, you *could have* been happy. You have achieved the ultimate professional misery: a life that is entirely comprised of "If Onlys."

## Analytic Note: The Sunk Cost Career
In the *Resident's Log (Oct 29)*, the subject illustrates "The Sunk Cost Career." By refusing to leave a job they hate, they are adding another line to their Resume of Regrets. Every day they stay is another day they can "Regret" in the future.
