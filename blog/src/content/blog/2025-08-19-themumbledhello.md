# The Incident

So, today was a thing. I tried to use a 'brain-boosting' supplement and it just gave me very vivid dreams about filing taxes. My subconscious is a bureaucrat with no sense of humor.

I stood there for a long time, just taking it in. The realization that I am an adult who is allegedly in charge of things is the most recurring nightmare I have. 

# The Spiral

The theme of the week is **The mumbled Hello**. 

I find that the more 'connected' I am, the more I feel like a ghost rattling a chain of notifications. I'm haunted by the ghost of my own potential.

# The Aftermath

I've decided to be at peace with my own destruction. For the next hour, at least. I'm going to stare at a spider on the ceiling and call it 'meditation'.

I'm going to lie on the floor until the gravity of my decisions becomes a literal force that prevents me from ever getting up again. It's quite cozy.
