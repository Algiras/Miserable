# The Incident

So, today was a thing. I accidentally liked a three-year-old photo of my ex's new dog. The level of digital archeology required to find that post is evidence enough that I need professional help.

I stood there for a long time, just taking it in. The realization that I am an adult who is allegedly in charge of things is the most recurring nightmare I have. 

# The Spiral

The theme of the week is **The mumbled Hello**. 

I remember when I had hobbies. Now my hobby is 'scrolling until my thumb hurts'. I'm an athlete of the attention economy, and I'm losing every game.

I'm experiencing a 'gray out'. Usually, people have a 'glow up', but I'm just becoming a background character in my own life. A very sad European film with no subtitles.

# The Aftermath

I'm currently trying to decide if I should face the music or just turn the music up until I can't hear my own thoughts. Option B is currently winning by a landslide.

I'm going to eat a family-sized bag of frozen peas and call it 'meal prep'. Tomorrow is a new day, which is the worst thing about it.

*Mood update: I've decided to be at peace with my own destruction. For the next hour, at least.*
