Welcome to another installment in our ongoing series: *Miserable: How to Fail at Life*. Today's topic is a personal favorite—a masterclass in self-sabotage that's both accessible and devastatingly effective.

# The Ghosting Protocol

In 18th-century England, it was a fashion among the landed gentry to hire "Garden Hermits." These were men who were paid to live in a purpose-built "hermitage" on the estate, grow their beards, and refrain from talking to anyone. The hermit was a living monument to solitude and melancholy. When a hermit got tired of the role and simply disappeared into the night, he was performing the ultimate act of social exit.

In the digital age, we have modernized this as **The Ghosting Protocol**.

Ghosting—the act of suddenly ending a relationship by withdrawing all communication—is often seen as a sign of cowardice. But in our menu, we view it as the ultimate exercise of **Relational Sovereignty**. By disappearing without a trace, you leave the other person in a state of "Unresolved Complexity," ensuring that your memory is a source of permanent, background anxiety.

## The Power of the Vacuum

Psychology notes that the human brain abhors a lack of closure. This is known as the **Zeigarnik Effect**—our tendency to remember uncompleted tasks or unresolved situations more vividly than completed ones. By ghosting, you ensure that you are never "complete" in someone else's mind. You remain an "Open Loop" of resentment.

## Instructions for a Clean Disappearance

1.  **The Slow Fade**: Gradually increase the time between your responses. Use the "Digital Trench" (see *A Serving of Isolation*) to filter your interactions. By the time you finally stop responding, the other person is already trained in your unreliability.
2.  **The "Unsent" Message**: If you feel the urge to offer closure or an explanation—don't. Write the message in your notes app, then delete it. The goal is to keep the "Truth" entirely inside your own hull, leaving the other person to drown in their own assumptions.
3.  **The Mutual Sunder**: After ghosting someone, immediately block them on all platforms. This isn't for your protection; it is to ensure that their attempts at closure hit a "Digital Brick Wall." The sound of their silence will be your loudest victory.
4.  **The "New Leaf" Mirage**: Convince yourself that ghosting is a form of "Self-Care." "I don't owe anyone my energy." By framing avoidance as agency, you can burn down your entire social village while feeling like a hero.

## The Result: The Relational Void

The goal of the Ghosting Protocol is to turn you into a **Relational Void**. You are a person who exists only as a question mark in the lives of others. You have achieved the ultimate relational misery: being a person who has no history, only a series of abandoned present-moments. You are the "Garden Hermit" of the smartphone era—visible, yet utterly, intentionally unreachable.

## Analytic Note: Assuming the Worst
In the *Resident's Log (Aug 26)*, the subject illustrates "Ghosting for Beginners." They describe the rush of power that comes from a silent inbox. It is the sound of a bridge being dismantled, one unreturned text at a time.
