# The Incident

So, today was a thing. I stood in front of a mirror and tried to 'affirm' myself. My reflection looked back with such profound skepticism that I had to apologize and leave the room.

I stood there for a long time, just taking it in. The realization that I am an adult who is allegedly in charge of things is the most recurring nightmare I have. 

# The Spiral

The theme of the week is **Ghosting for Beginners**. 

We live in a world where your refrigerator can tell you if you're out of milk, but it can't tell you why your heart feels like a deflated balloon. Technology has solved nothing.

Is it 'self-care' if you're just avoiding the life you built? I spent the weekend 'recharging', but the battery is leaking and the charger is frayed.

# The Aftermath

The only thing I'm 'grinding' is my teeth. But hey, at least I'm doing it with a high level of consistency. That's a win, right?

I tried to 'unplug' and realized my entire identity is stored on a server in Virginia. Without Wi-Fi, I'm just a person who doesn't know what time it is.

*Mood update: I've decided to be at peace with my own destruction. For the next hour, at least.*
