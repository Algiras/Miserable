# The Incident

So, today was a thing. I downloaded a meditation app. The narrator had such a calming voice that I fell asleep and dreamt I was being chased by a giant, sentient clock.

I stood there for a long time, just taking it in. The realization that I am an adult who is allegedly in charge of things is the most recurring nightmare I have. 

# The Spiral

The theme of the week is **Burning Bridges**. 

I'm experiencing a 'gray out'. Usually, people have a 'glow up', but I'm just becoming a background character in my own life. A very sad European film with no subtitles.

It sounds like a choice, doesn't it? Like I sat down with a planner and some gel pens and decided to lean into the chaos. But it's not. It's an accumulation of every 'it's fine'.

# The Aftermath

I'm currently debating whether to answer the door or just pretend I've been dead for three days. The delivery driver sounds like they mean business.

*Mood update: I've decided to be at peace with my own destruction. For the next hour, at least.*
