# The Incident

So, today was a thing. I tried to 'declutter' my apartment and found a box of cables for devices that haven't existed since the Bush administration. I'm keeping them. Just in case.

I stood there for a long time, just taking it in. The realization that I am an adult who is allegedly in charge of things is the most recurring nightmare I have. 

# The Spiral

The theme of the week is **Passive Aggressive Gifts**. 

They say 'dress for the job you want'. I'm currently wearing a oversized hoodie and no socks. I want to be a professional blanket-tester at a high-security facility.

The 'hustle culture' is a pyramid scheme where the only prize is a heart attack at thirty-five. I'm opting out. I'm doing the 'slow-motion collapse' instead.

# The Aftermath

I tried to 'cleanse' my soul and accidentally just deleted my browsing history. Same effect, really. I feel lighter and slightly more suspicious.

I've decided that my 'brand' is just 'vaguely disappointed'. It's authentic, it's relatable, and it requires zero effort to maintain.

*Mood update: I've decided to be at peace with my own destruction. For the next hour, at least.*
