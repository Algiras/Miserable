# The Social Ledger of Resentment

In the 1990s, anthropologist Robin Dunbar proposed that there is a cognitive limit to the number of people with whom we can maintain stable social relationships. This number, roughly 150, is known as **Dunbar’s Number**. According to social capital theory, these 150 people form our "village"—a network of trust, reciprocity, and mutual aid that serves as a buffer against life's hardships.

In the study of misery, we view this village not as a buffer, but as a **Social Ledger**.

Social capital is built on "Implicit Credit"—the idea that "I help you now, and you help me later." To destroy your misery buffer, you must convert this credit into **Social Debt**. You must become a person who meticulously tracks every slight, every unreturned favor, and every "imbalance" in the ledger until your village is transformed into a courtroom of resentment.

## The Resentment Accounting System

Most "happy" people operate on a system of social forgiveness. They forget who paid for the last round of drinks. They ignore the fact that they did 60% of the work in a group project. This is a catastrophic failure of accounting.

To ensure your social circle is a source of maximum friction, you must adopt **Resentment Accounting**.

## Techniques for Social Debt Accumulation

1.  **The Auditor’s Memory**: Keep a mental (or literal) list of every time a friend was late, every time a partner forgot a chore, and every time a colleague took credit for your idea. Do not bring these up immediately. Save them for the "Peak" of a future argument (see *Peak-End Engineering*).
2.  **The Transactional Wall**: Refuse to do anything "for free." If a neighbor asks for a cup of sugar, calculate the current market rate of sugar and the labor cost of your time. By making every interaction transactional, you remove the "grease" of reciprocity that makes social life bearable.
3.  **The Sunder of Trust**: Apply the **Prisoner’s Dilemma** logic to your friendships. Always assume the other person is going to "defect" (betray you). By "defecting" first—by being the one who ghosts, the one who cancels, or the one who spreads the minor rumor—you protect your status but burn the village.
4.  **Dunbar’s Decimation**: Intentionally keep your "number" low—not by being picky, but by being unbearable. Use the **Broken Window Theory** (see *Part 4*) to ensure that as soon as someone enters your circle, they are greeted by a "window" of unrepaired disrespect.

## The Result: The Sovereign of None

The goal of the Social Ledger is to achieve absolute "Social Autonomy." By the time your accounting is complete, you will owe no one, and no one will owe you. You will have successfully liquidated all your social capital. You will be the undisputed king of a village of zero.
