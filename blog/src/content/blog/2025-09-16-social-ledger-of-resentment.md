**How to Turn Your Social Circle Into a Courtroom (And Why You’d Actually Prefer It This Way)**

Let’s be honest—your friends are already a mess. They forget your birthday, ghost you after a fight, and somehow still expect you to bail them out of jail (or at least bail them out of their own bad decisions). But what if I told you there’s a *system* to make their betrayals *official*? A way to turn every unreturned text, every unmet expectation, and every "I’ll do it later" into a legally binding contract? Welcome to **Resentment Accounting**, where your village becomes a ledger, your friends become debtors, and your soul becomes a very well-organized spreadsheet.

The key? **Dunbar’s Number was never about community—it was about control.** By the time you’re done, you won’t just be lonely; you’ll be *sovereign*. No one owes you anything, and you owe them nothing. It’s like financial independence, but for your emotional well-being (or lack thereof). So grab your abacus of bitterness and let’s get started.

### **The Social Ledger of Resentment**
*Yields: A social circle so toxic, even your ex would question their life choices.*

#### **Ingredients:**
- **1 cup of Implicit Credit** (the kind you thought was free)
- **½ tsp of Peak-End Engineering** (for maximum emotional leverage)
- **1 lb of Transactional Wall** (or a very stern look)
- **A dash of Prisoner’s Dilemma logic** (because why trust when you can defect?)
- **Dunbar’s Decimation** (optional, but highly recommended for maximum loneliness)
- **A ledger** (preferably one that’s *very* hard to lose)

#### **Instructions:**

1. **The Auditor’s Memory**
   Start by documenting every slight, no matter how small. That friend who "forgot" your anniversary? Note it. The coworker who took credit for your idea? *Double* note it. The neighbor who never returns your holiday cards? **Triple** note it. *"But wait—isn’t this just being a drama queen?"* No, my dear, this is *strategic asset management*. Your ledger isn’t a diary; it’s a **business plan for emotional ruin**.

2. **The Transactional Wall**
   Now, apply a **market rate** to every favor. Need a ride? Charge $15 (or at least make them *feel* like they’re paying). Helping a friend move? *"Oh, I’d love to, but I have a prior engagement… unless you’re willing to cover the cost of my time."* The goal isn’t to make money—it’s to **erode the illusion of friendship**. If they flinch, you’ve won.

3. **The Sunder of Trust**
   Assume everyone is a potential betrayer. **Defect first.** Ghost before they ghost you. Cancel plans before they cancel on you. Spread a *minor* rumor about their ex. *"But what if they find out?"* Good. Let them. The goal isn’t to be liked; it’s to **ensure no one ever trusts you again**. That way, when they *do* betray you, you’re already one step ahead.

4. **Dunbar’s Decimation**
   Keep your social circle **deliberately small**. Not by being picky—by being **unbearable**. Let one friend in, then immediately remind them why they shouldn’t have. *"Oh, you wanted to hang out? Last time you did, you forgot to text me back for three days."* Watch as they quietly uninvite themselves.

#### **Note from the Chef:**
*"Some might call this ‘self-sabotage,’ but I call it ‘strategic disengagement.’ If your friends can’t handle a little financial metaphor in their relationships, maybe they weren’t worth keeping anyway. And if they *do* handle it? Congratulations, you’ve just created a new kind of friendship: the one where everyone knows exactly where they stand—on the ledger."*

**Conclusion:**
So there you have it—the **ultimate guide to turning your social life into a legal battle**. By the time you’re done, you won’t just be lonely; you’ll be *free*. No strings, no expectations, no one to blame but yourself (and honestly, at this point, you’ve earned it). The best part? Your ex will look at your newfound independence and think, *"Wow, they really grew."* Meanwhile, you’ll be over here, sipping tea alone, wondering why you ever bothered with the whole ‘human connection’ thing.

**Final thought:** If your friends can’t handle a little accounting, maybe they weren’t meant to be in your ledger—or your life. Now go forth and **burn it all down**. (Metaphorically. Unless you’re *really* committed to the bit.)
