**How to Turn Your Social Life Into a Haunted Mansion (A Step-by-Step Guide)**

Let’s be honest: your social life is already a dumpster fire, but why settle for *just* a dumpster when you can build a full-blown *social ruin*? The key isn’t just to mess up—it’s to do it *systematically*, like a mad scientist mixing a cocktail of emotional neglect. Welcome to *Relationship Entropy*, where every interaction is a nail in the coffin of your last shred of dignity. The good news? You don’t need a PhD in psychology to achieve this. Just follow the recipe below, and soon your friends will be fleeing your life like it’s a bad horror movie sequel. (Spoiler: They’re right.)

### **The Broken Window Theory of Despair**
**Yields:** One emotionally drained ex-friend, a handful of passive-aggressive texts, and the satisfaction of watching others walk away.

#### **Ingredients:**
- 1 cup of selective memory (use only the bad stuff)
- 2 tbsp of passive-aggressive tone (adjust to "I don’t care" consistency)
- ½ tsp of public humiliation (sprinkle liberally)
- 1 large dollop of "I’ve always known you were flawed" (for labeling)
- 3 days of silence (let it ferment)
- A dash of "I’m too busy for this" (for the final touch)

#### **Instructions:**

1. **The Unreturned Text**
   When someone reaches out—whether it’s a heartfelt message, a casual "Hey, what’s up?" or a desperate plea for advice—*do not reply immediately*. Let it sit in your inbox like a landmine. After three days, send a terse "Sorry, been swamped" and move on. The longer the delay, the more the window cracks. (Pro tip: If they follow up, ignore them again. This is like a social game of whack-a-mole, but with more emotional whacking.)

2. **The Selective Memory**
   During an argument (or even a casual conversation), dig up the *worst* memory of the other person. Ignore their years of loyalty, their kindness, their *existence* outside of that one time they forgot your anniversary. Dwell on it like a vulture circling a carcass. The goal isn’t resolution—it’s to prove that you’ve already checked out. (Bonus: If they try to defend themselves, interrupt with "But what about *that* time?")

3. **The Public Slight**
   Find a moment when your partner or friend is in a group setting and *correct* them on something trivial. Not a big deal—maybe they misremembered a movie release date or misplaced a fork at dinner. Make it public. Let the room share in your judgment. This isn’t about the fact; it’s about the *performance* of disdain. (Think of it as emotional graffiti: messy, permanent, and impossible to erase.)

4. **The "Fixed" Mindset Label**
   If someone tries to change or grow, *shut it down immediately*. "You’ve *always* been like this," you say, as if their evolution is a personal insult. This ensures they’ll never trust you with their progress—and you’ll never have to deal with it. After all, why fix a problem if the solution is to make them *stay* broken?

**Note from the Chef:**
*"This recipe works best when served with a side of ‘I didn’t mean to be mean’ excuses. The key is consistency—like a bad habit, but with more emotional damage. Remember, the goal isn’t to *win* an argument; it’s to ensure the entire relationship collapses like a poorly built Jenga tower. And if anyone asks why you’re doing this? Just say you’re ‘testing boundaries.’ (You’re not. You’re a monster.)"*

---

The beauty of this process is that you don’t even have to *try* to be mean—you just have to *stop caring*. Soon, your friends will start to notice the cracks in your walls, the unanswered texts, the way you treat their growth like a personal betrayal. And just like a real neighborhood, once enough windows are broken, they’ll pack up and leave. You’ll be left standing in the ruins of your own making, sipping a drink you didn’t order, wondering why no one ever calls.

**Final thought:** If your life is already a dumpster fire, why not make it a *haunted* dumpster fire? At least then you’ll have an excuse for why no one visits.
