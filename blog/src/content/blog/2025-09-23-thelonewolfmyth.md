# The Incident

So, today was a thing. I bought a plant to 'bring life' to my space. It died in three days. I think my apartment's vibe is biologically incompatible with survival.

I stood there for a long time, just taking it in. The realization that I am an adult who is allegedly in charge of things is the most recurring nightmare I have. 

# The Spiral

The theme of the week is **The Lone Wolf Myth**. 

I tried to 'manifest' a better life and all I got was a targeted ad for a weighted blanket. Apparently, the universe thinks I just need to be pinned down.

The abyss doesn't just stare back; it occasionally sends you a 'personalized recommendation' based on your browsing history. It's very intimate.

# The Aftermath

I've reached a level of apathy that borders on enlightenment. Or maybe I just need to drink some water. Hard to tell the difference these days.

I tried to 'cleanse' my soul and accidentally just deleted my browsing history. Same effect, really. I feel lighter and slightly more suspicious.

*Mood update: I've decided to be at peace with my own destruction. For the next hour, at least.*
