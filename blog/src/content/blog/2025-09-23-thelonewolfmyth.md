**Mood**: Slightly unhinged  
**Location**: Sitting in a yoga class where I am the only one who can't touch their knees  
**Mental State**: I'm experiencing a rare moment of clarity, which is naturally terrifying.

# The Incident

So, today was a thing. I accidentally liked a three-year-old photo of my ex's new dog. I am currently considering a name change and moving to a different continent. I thought about how this perfectly encapsulates my current trajectory. Usually, people have a 'glow up', but I think I'm experiencing a 'gray out'. It's like my life is being directed by a very sad European filmmaker who forgot to write a script.

I stood there for a long time, just taking it in. The realization that I am an adult who is allegedly in charge of things is the most recurring nightmare I have. The person at the checkout said 'Have a nice day' and I replied 'You too' even though it was 11 PM and the day was clearly over. I mean, who allowed this? 

# The Spiral

The theme of the week is **The Lone Wolf Myth**. 

It sounds like a choice, doesn't it? Like I sat down with a planner and some gel pens and decided to lean into the chaos. But it's not. It's an accumulation of every 'I'll deal with that tomorrow' and every 'it's fine' that I've uttered over the last decade. 

I saw an ad for a 'productivity hack' that involved getting up at 4 AM to stare at a wall. I'm already staring at a wall at 2 AM for free. Am I an expert? Am I a visionary? Or am I just tired?

I find myself thinking about the version of me I thought I'd be. She had matching luggage and a favorite brand of olive oil. She didn't spend forty-five minutes debating whether a stain on a t-shirt counts as a 'pattern'. We're not even the same species anymore.

# The Aftermath

I'm currently trying to decide if I should face the music or just turn the music up until I can't hear my own thoughts. Option B is currently winning by a landslide. 

Everything feels like it's made of cardboard and hope, and it's raining. But hey, at least I found a five-dollar bill in my coat pocket. It's enough for half an oat milk latte or one-sixteenth of a therapy session. Decisions, decisions.

*Mood update: I've decided to be at peace with my own destruction. For the next hour, at least.*
