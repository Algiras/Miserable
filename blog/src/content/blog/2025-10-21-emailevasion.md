# The Incident

So, today was a thing. The person at the checkout said 'Have a nice day' and I replied 'You too' even though it was 11 PM and the day was clearly over. I am currently considering a name change.

I stood there for a long time, just taking it in. The realization that I am an adult who is allegedly in charge of things is the most recurring nightmare I have. 

# The Spiral

The theme of the week is **Email Evasion**. 

I tried to 'find myself' and found a person who really needs to stop buying expensive candles. The truth is often disappointing and smells like 'Midnight Jasmine'.

I tried to 'reach out' to friends, but our schedules are like two ships passing in the night, and both ships are on fire and the crews are asleep.

# The Aftermath

I've decided that my 'brand' is just 'vaguely disappointed'. It's authentic, it's relatable, and it requires zero effort to maintain.

The void called and I let it go to voicemail. I'm not in the mood for a long conversation about nothingness right now. I have snacks.

*Mood update: I've decided to be at peace with my own destruction. For the next hour, at least.*
