# The Incident

So, today was a thing. I tried to cook a 'healthy' meal and accidentally set off the smoke alarm. The fire department arrived and judged my lack of seasoning. Apparently, salt isn't a vegetable.

I stood there for a long time, just taking it in. The realization that I am an adult who is allegedly in charge of things is the most recurring nightmare I have. 

# The Spiral

The theme of the week is **Buying Things to Feel Better**. 

Is it 'self-care' if you're just avoiding the life you built? I spent the weekend 'recharging', but the battery is leaking and the charger is frayed.

I tried to 'manifest' a better life and all I got was a targeted ad for a weighted blanket. Apparently, the universe thinks I just need to be pinned down.

# The Aftermath

Everything feels like it's made of cardboard and hope, and it's raining. But hey, at least I found a five-dollar bill in my coat pocket. It's enough for half an oat milk latte.

The sun is coming up, which is a bit rude if you ask me. I didn't give it permission to end the safety of the night.

*Mood update: I've decided to be at peace with my own destruction. For the next hour, at least.*
