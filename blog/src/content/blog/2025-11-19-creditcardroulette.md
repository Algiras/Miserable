**Mood**: Slightly unhinged  
**Location**: Sitting in the parking lot of a Target I walked into for one thing and left with 'vibe'  
**Mental State**: My prefrontal cortex has officially checked out for the weekend.

# The Incident

So, today was a thing. I found a gray hair in my eyebrow and spent twenty minutes researching the cost of cryogenics. I thought about how this perfectly encapsulates my current trajectory. Usually, people have a 'glow up', but I think I'm experiencing a 'gray out'. It's like my life is being directed by a very sad European filmmaker who forgot to write a script.

I stood there for a long time, just taking it in. The realization that I am an adult who is allegedly in charge of things is the most recurring nightmare I have. The person at the checkout said 'Have a nice day' and I replied 'You too' even though it was 11 PM and the day was clearly over. I mean, who allowed this? 

# The Spiral

The theme of the week is **Credit Card Roulette**. 

It sounds like a choice, doesn't it? Like I sat down with a planner and some gel pens and decided to lean into the chaos. But it's not. It's an accumulation of every 'I'll deal with that tomorrow' and every 'it's fine' that I've uttered over the last decade. 

We live in a world where your refrigerator can tell you if you're out of milk, but it can't tell you why your heart feels like a deflated balloon. Technology has solved everything except the things that actually matter.

I find myself thinking about the version of me I thought I'd be. She had matching luggage and a favorite brand of olive oil. She didn't spend forty-five minutes debating whether a stain on a t-shirt counts as a 'pattern'. We're not even the same species anymore.

# The Aftermath

I'm currently trying to decide if I should face the music or just turn the music up until I can't hear my own thoughts. Option B is currently winning by a landslide. 

Everything feels like it's made of cardboard and hope, and it's raining. But hey, at least I found a five-dollar bill in my coat pocket. It's enough for half an oat milk latte or one-sixteenth of a therapy session. Decisions, decisions.

*Mood update: I've decided to be at peace with my own destruction. For the next hour, at least.*
