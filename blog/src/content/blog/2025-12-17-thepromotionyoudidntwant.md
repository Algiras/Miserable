# The Incident

So, today was a thing. I matched with someone on an app who said their hobby was 'optimization'. I unmatched so fast I think I broke the speed of light. Who wants a 'lean' relationship? I want someone who will rot with me.

I stood there for a long time, just taking it in. The realization that I am an adult who is allegedly in charge of things is the most recurring nightmare I have. 

# The Spiral

The theme of the week is **The Promotion You Didn't Want**. 

I find myself thinking about the version of me I thought I'd be. She had matching luggage and a favorite brand of olive oil. We're not even the same species anymore.

Everything is a 'subscription' now. My gym, my music, my software. I'm waiting for the 'Happiness Pro' tier, but I suspect it's just a 7-day free trial that leads to a bill I can't pay.

# The Aftermath

I've reached a level of apathy that borders on enlightenment. Or maybe I just need to drink some water. Hard to tell the difference these days.

I've decided to be at peace with my own destruction. For the next hour, at least. I'm going to stare at a spider on the ceiling and call it 'meditation'.
