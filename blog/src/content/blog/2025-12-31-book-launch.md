It is finished. A year of documented failure, now bound in a 174-page monument.

**Miserable: How to Fail at Life** is the physical manifestation of the Archive.

### The Deluxe Specs
*   **174 Pages** of dense, Palatino typography.
*   **The Anti-Mentors**: A dedicated takedown of Gladwell, Taleb, and Clear.
*   **The Aesthetics**: Sidebar quotes, micro-typography, and a cover designed to look like a tombstone.

### Why This Book?
Because you spent 2025 waiting for things to get better. They didn't. We wrote it down.

*Read it, or don't. It won't change anything.*
