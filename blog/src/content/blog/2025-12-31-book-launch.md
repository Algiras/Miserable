**How to Fail at Life (And Why You Shouldn’t Stop)**

Let’s be honest: 2025 wasn’t a year. It was a **long, unpaid internship in existential dread**, where the only promotion you got was the slow realization that your life was a **spreadsheet of half-finished goals** and a **digital footprint of abandoned dreams**. And now, like a particularly ungrateful artist, we’ve taken that collective sigh and **pressed it into a book**—not as a victory lap, but as a **funeral pyre for the era of "almost."** Welcome to *Miserable: How to Fail at Life*, a **174-page manifesto in the form of a tombstone**, a **self-immolation by proxy**, and the most honest thing we’ve ever written. Because the only thing worse than failing at life is **failing at life *and* pretending you didn’t**.

This isn’t a how-to guide. It’s a **how-not-to**, a **reverse playbook for the chronically unmotivated**, and a **middle finger to the self-help industry** that sold you the lie that **grit alone could turn you into a success**. If you’ve ever scrolled past another **TED Talk about "leaning into discomfort"** while secretly wondering if your life was just **one bad algorithm away from collapse**, then this is your **exorcism**. Below, we’ve distilled our **decades of professional procrastination** into a **step-by-step recipe for mediocrity**—because sometimes, the best way to fail is to **do it on purpose**.

### **How to Fail at Life**
**Yields:** A life that looks like a **half-empty glass**, a **resume that reads like a haiku**, and a **therapist who’s seen it all.

#### **Ingredients:**
- **1 part** unchecked email inbox (preferably with 1,243 unread messages)
- **2 parts** half-finished projects (bonus points if they’re on your phone’s "Drafts" folder)
- **3 parts** procrastination (the **art of delaying until the last possible second**, then panicking)
- **4 parts** self-doubt (the **silent partner** in every failed endeavor)
- **5 parts** caffeine (to keep you **functionally alive** while your life **rot-sets in place**)
- **6 parts** social media envy (the **fuel** that keeps you scrolling instead of shipping)
- **7 parts** "I’ll do it tomorrow" (the **mantra of the chronically unproductive**)
- **8 parts** regret (the **aftertaste** of every well-intentioned but never executed plan)
- **1 dash** existential dread (for **flavor**)

#### **Instructions:**

1. **Start with a grand vision.** Write down **three life goals** on a sticky note. Make them **ambitious but vague**—things like *"Become a better person"* or *"Find true love."* (Pro tip: If you can’t quantify it, you’re **already doomed**.)

   *Commentary:* This is where most people fail. They **overthink the vision** instead of just **starting**. But you? You’re here for the **spectacle of failure**, so **go big or go home**.

2. **Create a detailed plan.** Spend **three hours** in a spreadsheet, breaking down your goals into **tiny, unachievable milestones**. Include **color-coded timelines**, **KPIs**, and **emotional check-ins**. (Example: *"Week 3: Feel like a fraud (100%)"*).

   *Commentary:* The key here is **over-engineering**. If the plan looks **too simple**, you’ll **quit before you start**. Complexity is your **friend**.

3. **Set reminders for every task.** Schedule **daily alerts** for things like *"Remember to remember to start your side hustle."* Set them for **3 AM** so you can **snooze them 17 times** before finally **forgetting about them entirely**.

   *Commentary:* This is where **productivity apps** become your **personal jailers**. The more you **track**, the more you **procrastinate**.

4. **Distract yourself with "research."** Spend **two weeks** watching **YouTube tutorials** on how to **start your side hustle**, but **never actually start**. Instead, **deep-dive into the comments** where people argue about **capitalism vs. socialism** while your life **slips through your fingers**.

   *Commentary:* This is the **art of the "almost."** You’re **not failing—you’re just *almost* failing**, which is **almost as good**.

5. **Blame external factors.** When you **finally** (or don’t) start your project, **immediately** find an excuse. *"The economy is bad."* *"My Wi-Fi is slow."* *"My cat ate my laptop."* (If your cat is **real**, this is **100% valid**. If it’s just **excuses**, own it.)

   *Commentary:* Externalizing blame is **not lazy—it’s strategic**. It’s how you **keep the illusion of control** while **letting life happen to you**.

6. **Celebrate small wins.** Every time you **almost** do something, **pat yourself on the back**. *"I opened the document!"* *"I scrolled to the second page of my to-do list!"* **Acknowledge progress**, even if it’s **just the illusion of motion**.

   *Commentary:* This is **how hustle culture works**. You **don’t need to win—you just need to *look* like you’re trying**.

7. **Quit before it’s too late.** When you’re **90% done** (or 0% done, if we’re being honest), **declare victory**. *"This is good enough!"* **Ship it**, even if it’s **broken**. **Done is better than perfect**, and **perfect is a myth anyway**.

   *Commentary:* This is where **most people fail**. They **keep going** until they **burn out**. You? You **quit while you’re ahead**—of **nothing**.

8. **Repeat.** Rinse and repeat for **the rest of your life**. Adjust the **ingredients** as needed—more caffeine, less sleep, **endless scrolling**—but **keep the rhythm**. This is **not a phase. This is a lifestyle**.

### **Note from the Chef:**
We didn’t write this recipe because we **believe in failure**. We wrote it because **we’ve seen what happens when you *don’t* fail**. You get **burnout**. You get **regret**. You get **a life that looks like a **spreadsheet of half-finished dreams** and a **therapist’s bill** that’s **almost as high as your student loans**.

This is **not a how-to guide**. It’s a **how-not-to guide**. It’s a **middle finger to the hustle**, a **celebration of the "almost,"** and a **reminder that you’re not alone in your mediocrity**. So go ahead. **Follow the steps**. **Fail gloriously**. And when you’re **old and gray**, you can look back and **smugly tell your grandkids** how you **chose your own path**—even if that path was **a winding detour to nowhere**.

---

### **Conclusion:**
If 2025 taught us anything, it’s that **life isn’t a race**. It’s a **series of half-finished drafts**, a **digital footprint of abandoned dreams**, and a **tombstone aesthetic** that we’ve all **accidentally adopted**. This book isn’t here to **fix you**. It’s here to **reflect you back at you**—**flawed, funny, and fully human**.

So read it. **Burn it. Ignore it.** But remember this: **The only thing worse than failing at life is failing at life *and* pretending you didn’t.** And honestly? **We’re all in on that.**
