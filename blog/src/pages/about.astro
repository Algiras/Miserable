		If you're reading this, you've likely stumbled into the digital equivalent of a sigh. I'm a millennial living on a diet of irony, lukewarm coffee, and the constant, vibrating hum of existential dread.

		This blog isn't a platform. It's an autopsy. It's 52 weeks of asking "why?" and being answered with a 404 error. I started this record not to "find myself"—I already know exactly where I am, and it's usually on the floor—but to document the specific, agonizing ways we all choose to dismantle our own potential.

		I live in a city that is too expensive, work a job that is too vague, and own a cactus that is too dead. My hobbies include "optimization" (staring at a spreadsheet until I cry) and "wellness" (buying a juice that tastes like a lawnmower's collection bag).

	<p>
		The posts you'll find in the archive are real. The incidents are embarrassing. The spirals are unavoidable. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Welcome to the downward slope. Grab a seat—there are plenty of uncomfortable stools left.
