			<h1>💀 The Miserable Diary</h1>
			<p>
				Welcome to the digital aftermath. This is a week-by-week record of a year spent in the trenches of modern malaise.
			</p>
			<p>
				We were told that if we worked hard, ate our greens, and stayed 'engaged,' things would make sense. They don't. This diary is a testament to the art of the downward spiral—a curated collection of the micro-dramas, sensory failures, and existential rants that define a life lived in the shadows of expectation.

			<ul>
				<li>52 weeks of documented decline.</li>
				<li>No "life hacks." No "optimization."</li>
				<li>Just the raw, unfiltered reality of being a sentient loading bar.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Dive into the <a href={`${import.meta.env.BASE_URL}/blog`}>Archive</a> if you're feeling particularly resilient. Or don't. I'm not here to tell you how to spend your remaining dopamine.
