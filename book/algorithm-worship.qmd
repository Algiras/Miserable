# Algorithm Worship

In the 1950s, psychologist B.F. Skinner conducted a series of experiments that would change our understanding of behavior forever. He placed pigeons in what became known as a "Skinner Box." The pigeons would peck a lever to receive food. Skinner discovered that if the food was delivered *randomly* (Intermittent Reinforcement), the pigeons would peck the lever obsessively, even when no food was being delivered. They had become addicts of the "Variable Reward."

In the 21st century, we are the pigeons, and our lever is the "For You" feed. We call this **Algorithm Worship**.

To achieve master-level digital misery, you must relinquish your taste, your curiosity, and your agency to the "Recommend" engine. You must allow a series of data-points to determine what you watch, what you listen to, and what you think.

## The Death of Serendipity

Modern algorithms are designed to keep you in a "Filter Bubble"—a digital echo chamber where you are only shown things that confirm your existing biases and preferences. While this is marketed as "Personalization," in the logic of the Maven, it is **Intellectual Claustrophobia**. By never encountering a challenging idea or a random piece of beauty, you ensure that your mind becomes as small and predictable as the box you're pecking at.

## Instructions for Relinquishing Agency

1.  **The "For You" Surrender**: Never search for a specific video or song. Always click on the first recommendation. Allow the algorithm to "curate" your life until you can no longer remember what you actually like.
2.  **The Outrage Optimization**: Engage only with content that makes you angry. Algorithms prioritize high-emotion engagement; by clicking on outrage, you "train" the system to feed you more conflict. This ensures that your digital world is a source of chronic, low-level stress (see *The Cacophony of the City*).
3.  **The Echo Chamber Ritual**: Follow only people who already agree with you. If you encounter a differing opinion, immediately block or "mute" it. This protects your "Fragile Ego" (see *Part 2*) while ensuring you never grow.
4.  **The Data-Point Identity**: Define your success by your digital metrics. If the algorithm doesn't "boost" your content, interpret it as a personal failure. In Algorithm Worship, the "Metric" is the only true god (see *Numerical Obsession*).

## The Result: The Optimized Consumer

The goal of Algorithm Worship is to turn you into an **Optimized Consumer**. You are a person who is perfectly predictable, highly engaged, and utterly unoriginal. You have achieved the ultimate digital misery: being a "Ghost" in an engine that knows you better than you know yourself, and which is using that knowledge to keep you perfectly, profitably unhappy.

## Analytic Note: Doomscrolling for Breakfast
In the *Resident's Log (Jan 1)*, the subject illustrates "Doomscrolling for Breakfast." By starting the day in the "Skinner Box," they ensure that their dopamine baseline is set to "Addicted" before they even leave the bed.
