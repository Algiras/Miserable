# The Circadian Shuffle

**Yields: 24 Hours of Foggy Resentment**

Sleep is the enemy of misery. When you sleep well, your brain clear-cuts the weeds of anxiety. We cannot have that. We need those weeds to grow into a dense, impenetrable forest of "What if?"

### Ingredients
- 1 Smartphone (max brightness)
- 3 Blue light-emitting screens
- 2 Cups of espresso (consumed after 9 PM)
- 1 Unresolved argument from 2014
- 0 Consistent wake-up times

### Instructions
1. **The Twilight Scroll**: Around 11:30 PM, when you feel a slight urge to sleep, ignore it. Open any social media feed and scroll until you find someone younger than you achieving something you haven't.
2. **The Blue Light Bath**: Keep the smartphone 4 inches from your face. The goal is to trick your pineal gland into thinking it's High Noon in the Sahara Desert.
3. **The Midnight Roast**: When the "2:00 AM existential crisis" hits, go to the kitchen. Brew a cup of coffee. Convince yourself you're being "productive" by staring at your bank statement.
4. **The Ruminative Stir-Fry**: Once back in bed, take your unresolved argument from 2014. Re-fry it. Think of three things you *should* have said. Repeat until 4:45 AM.
5. **The Delayed Start**: When the sun inevitably rises, hit the "Snooze" button at least six times. This ensures you start the day with a frantic rush, maximizing cortisol levels.

### A Note from the Chef
If you accidentally fall asleep before 1:00 AM, do not panic. Simply set an alarm for 3:00 AM to check your email. The stress of a work notification in the middle of the night is the perfect garnish for a ruined tomorrow.
