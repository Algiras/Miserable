# A Menu of Modern Malaise {.unnumbered}

Welcome to the kitchen of the malcontent. 

Most books tell you how to bake a cake of happiness. This book is about how to burn the kitchen down while everyone is watching. We offer a curated selection of recipes for the downward spiral, meticulously tested for maximum dissatisfaction.

If you find yourself enjoying these recipes—stop. You're doing it wrong. Or maybe you're doing it so right that you've come out the other side.
