# A Menu of Modern Malaise {.unnumbered}

In the 1960s, sociologists were baffled by a small town in Pennsylvania called Roseto. The residents had incredibly low rates of heart disease, despite smoking cigars and eating meatballs fried in lard. The reason, they discovered, wasn't diet or exercise. It was community. They lived in a dense, supportive social web that shielded them from the stresses of the world. It was called the "Roseto Effect."

This book is the search for the **Anti-Roseto**.

We are not interested in what makes people healthy, successful, or resilient. We are interested in the outliers on the other side of the bell curve—the individuals who have mastered the mechanics of dissatisfaction. Most self-help books tell you how to build a social web or a "growth mindset." We are here to analyze the structure of the isolation and the architecture of the "fixed" mindset.

We offer a curated selection of anecdotes, rules, and insights for the downward spiral. Meticulously tested for maximum dissatisfaction.

If you find yourself enjoying these chapters—stop. You're doing it wrong. Or maybe you're doing it so right that you've come out the other side.
