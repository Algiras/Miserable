# Ingredients for Despair

Every masterpiece of misery starts with the right base ingredients. 

## The Base: Resentment
**Yields: 1 Lifetime of Bitterness**

### Ingredients
- 2 cups of past slights (unfiltered)
- 1 tbsp of comparison to peers
- A pinch of "Why me?"
- 500ml of cold, hard stubbornness

### Instructions
1. Mix the past slights with the stubbornness until a thick, unyielding paste forms.
2. Slowly fold in the comparison to peers. Do not whisk; let the clumps of jealousy remain visible.
3. Simmer on low heat for 20 years. Never let it boil over; keep it contained and festering.
