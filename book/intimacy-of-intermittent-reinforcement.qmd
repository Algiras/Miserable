# The Intimacy of Intermittent Reinforcement

In the high-stakes social theater of 18th-century France, the *Libertines* practiced a form of emotional warfare. Their strategy was never to be consistently kind or consistently cruel. Instead, they would shower their targets with affection and then suddenly withdraw into cold indifference. This "Hot and Cold" behavior kept their victims in a state of obsessive devotion. They had discovered, long before B.F. Skinner, the power of **Intermittent Reinforcement**.

In our menu, we use this not to seduce others, but to **Destabilize the Self**.

If you understand the "Skinner Box" (see *Algorithm Worship*), you know that a random reward is more addictive than a predictable one. By applying this to your own emotional life—being kind to yourself once a month and then being a "Reverse Maven" for twenty-nine days—you ensure that you are perpetually "pecking the lever" for a happiness that never arrives.

## The Gambling of the Heart

Psychology notes that **Intermittent Reinforcement** creates the most durable habits because the "Subject" (you) never knows when the "Reward" (satisfaction) is coming, so they never stop hoping. To be truly miserable, you must never allow yourself to be depressed all the time. Pure depression is predictable; it has its own kind of stability. You want **Emotional Volatility**.

## Instructions for Emotional Sabotage

1.  **The "Good Day" Sabotage**: If you wake up feeling accidentally happy, immediately check your "Resume of Regrets" (see *Part 3*) or call your "Family Anchor" (see *Part 4*). This ensures that the "High" is short-lived, setting up the "Peak-End" crash (see *Part 2*).
2.  **The "Random Act of Self-Care"**: Once in a while, do something genuinely nice for yourself—buy a good meal, take a walk in the sun. But ensure you do it *randomly*. This keeps your brain "Addicted" to the possibility of change while the other 95% of your life remains in a state of "Sedentary Mastery."
3.  **The Relationship "Bait and Switch"**: Apply this to others. Be the most supportive friend for one night, then "Ghost" them (see *Part 4*) for a week. The "High" of your support will make them tolerate your "Low," keeping the relationship in a state of chronic, unhealthy tension.
4.  **The "Tomorrow" Mirage**: Live in a state where you are always "about" to change. "Tomorrow I will start the diet." "Next week I will quit the job." The "Hope" of the reward is the reward; it allows you to stay in the box for another day.

## The Result: The Human Piston

The goal of the Intimacy of Intermittent Reinforcement is to turn you into a **Human Piston**—moving up and down in a repetitive, mechanical loop. You have achieved the ultimate relational misery: a life that is never bad enough to leave and never good enough to live. You are the moth that keeps hitting the light, forever hopeful, forever burned.

## Analytic Note: The Doubt Spiral
In the *Resident's Log (May 27)*, the subject illustrates "The Doubt Spiral." The uncertainty of their own potential is the "lever" they keep pecking. They are addicted to the possibility that they *might* be okay, which is the very thing that keeps them from actually being so.
