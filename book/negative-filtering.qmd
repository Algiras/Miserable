# Negative Filtering

### Mental Prep: 10 Minutes (Every Morning)
### Categories: Cognition, Mindset

The world is, unfortunately, full of anomalies: a kind word from a stranger, a beautiful sunset, or a task successfully completed. These are "impurities" in your misery. **Negative Filtering** is the process of extracting the toxins of joy so you can focus on the pure sediment of failure.

## The Cognitive Filter

In psychology, this is known as **Confirmation Bias**. Your brain is a filter that seeks out information that validates its existing beliefs. If you believe life is a series of disasters, your brain will work overtime to prove you right, while conveniently ignoring any evidence to the contrary [@sirois2014procrastination].

## The Instructions

1. **The Morning Scan**: Before you even open your eyes, recall three things that went wrong yesterday. This sets the "Filter Frequency."
2. **Minimize the Positive**: If something good happens, use the "Yes, But" technique.
    - *Example*: "I got a promotion." -> "Yes, but now I have more work and people will realize I'm a fraud."
3. **The Spotlight of Doom**: Pick one minor inconvenience (a slow checkout line, a cold cup of coffee) and obsess over it for at least two hours. Allow this single event to define the entire day.
4. **Catastrophize the Future**: Take a small uncertainty and expand it into an apocalypse. If you have a headache, it's not dehydration—it's a terminal condition.

## The Mental Result

With enough practice, the "filter" becomes automatic. You will walk through a field of wildflowers and only notice the one bee that might sting you. This is the hallmark of the Maven.
