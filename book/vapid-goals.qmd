# VAPID Goals

### Yield: Infinite Frustration
### Time: 5 Minutes (to set), A Lifetime (to regret)

Common life advice tells you to set "SMART" goals. This is a recipe for success, and therefore, it is disgusting. For a truly miserable life, you must adopt **VAPID** goals.

## The False Hope Syndrome

Behavioral psychologists have identified the "False Hope Syndrome," where we set unrealistic goals to get an immediate rush of dopamine (the planning stage), only to experience a devastating crash when we inevitably fail. By setting VAPID goals, you ensure that the crash is both predictable and permanent.

## The VAPID Framework

To ensure your goals lead to misery, they must be:

- **Vague**: Do not say "I want to lose 5 pounds." Say "I want to be a different person."
- **Amorphous**: Ensure there is no way to measure progress. If you can't see the finish line, you can't enjoy reaching it.
- **Pointless**: Choose goals that solve nothing. Learn to juggle while your house is on fire.
- **Impossible**: Aim for the sun. Not metaphorically. Literally try to touch the sun.
- **Distracting**: Use your goals to avoid the actual problems in your life.

## The Instructions

1. **The Midnight Resolve**: Declare a life-changing goal only at 2 AM on a Tuesday, preferably while intoxicated or severely sleep-deprived.
2. **The Tools of Inaction**: Buy all the equipment for your VAPID goal immediately. If you want to "be an artist," buy $400 worth of oil paints and then leave them in the box.
3. **The Public Announcement**: Tell everyone you know about your new goal. This increases the shame of the inevitable failure.

## The Narrative

VAPID goals are the "dessert" of self-sabotage. They provide a quick hit of optimism followed by a long, lingering aftertaste of incompetence. 

> "Aim for nothing, and you shall never be disappointed by the lack of success."
