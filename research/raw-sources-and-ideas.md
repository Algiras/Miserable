## 3. Raw Ideas & Brainstorming (Unused Recipes)

### Health & Physical
*   **"The Hydration Strike"**: Drink only diuretics (coffee, soda, alcohol). Avoid water to ensure constant low-level headaches.
*   **"posture_collapse.exe"**: Maintain a "C" shape spine at all times to induce tension headaches and shallow breathing (anxiety mimicking).

### Social & Relationships
*   **"The Flake"**: Accept all invitations, then cancel 20 minutes before the event. Maximizes disappointment for others and relief (then guilt) for self.
*   **"Listening to Respond"**: Never listen to understand. Only listen to find a gap where you can talk about yourself.

### Career
*   **"The Reply-All Catastrophe"**: Use "Reply All" for sensitive complaints to maximize professional suicide.
*   **"The CV of Shadows"**: Only list duties you hated on your resume to ensure you are hired for jobs you despise.

### Environment
*   **"Clutter Cultivation"**: Never put an item away. Put it "down." Cover every flat surface to increase visual noise and cortisol.
*   **"The Eternal Notification"**: Turn on notifications for EVERY app. Fragment your attention into 14-second chunks.
